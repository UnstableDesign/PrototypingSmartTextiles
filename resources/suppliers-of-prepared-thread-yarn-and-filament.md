# Suppliers of  Prepared Thread, Yarn and Filament

The kinds of yarns that we have ordered and have in the lab recently come from various suppliers, but have also come with quite of lot of improvisation and collaborating with European friends in order to order \(including some email translations, etc.\). You'll also notice that some suppliers use the language of yarn to describe their yarns \(ply, denier, etc\) while others describe them more like wires \(diameter or AWG\).

If you are making your own hybrid yarns, then you will also need to combine them with materials like linen, cotton, wool, silk etc. For those kinds of supplies, we typically order from [Halcyon Yarns](https://halcyonyarn.com/) or the [Woolery](https://woolery.com/). If you just want to be inspired by the glory of fiber and yarn, you can shop [Habu Yarns](https://www.habutextiles.com/collections/yarn?page=4) to source things like horse hair and paper yarns.
