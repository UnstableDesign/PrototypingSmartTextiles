# How to Contribute

It is our intention for this book to become a resource that an entire community can contribute towards. Hoping this will be an open source book, forked, edited, and added to by others. 

If you would like to contribute to the book, visit the GitHub repository for the project at: [https://github.com/UnstableDesign/PrototypingSmartTextiles](https://github.com/UnstableDesign/PrototypingSmartTextiles) 

If you are comfortable with GitHub and the command line interface, [you can follow these instructions to make changes and submit pull requests to the organizers. ](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/)

If you would be more comfortable with a user interface, you can[ download a desktop application from Github Desktop ](https://desktop.github.com/)and follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop). 

Because Github will associate any of your changes with your GitHub account, you will maintain a kind of credit for the additions that you make. 

You are also welcome to email us at unstabledesignlab@gmail.com if you have small suggestions for improvements and added content and we can manually add it to the document. The benefit of using Git is that it streamlines credit for contributions. We have not yet determined a process for doing this based on email requests.
