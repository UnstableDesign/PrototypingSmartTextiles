singles describes the first structure that emerges after roving or top are given spin. Most yarns are often made from several strands of singles. 

Singles are produced when [roving or top](roving-and-top.md) are twisted in the process of [spinning](../process/spinning/), turning into a longer yarn-like structure. Most yarns are created through one or more singles joined together, in a process called [plying](../process/plying/) which adds additional structure and texture to yarn. singles are always unbalanced, as they consist only of fibers with one direction of spin \([called Z or S twist](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Z-twist)\). The amount of twist within singles is said to imbue it with a certain amount of "[energy](https://www.interweave.com/article/knitting/what-is-energized-yarn/)". This energy can be [harnessed in knitting ](https://yarnsub.com/articles/twist)and [weaving](http://www.fibermusings.net/archives/1952) to create different[ elastic or dimensional shapes and structures](https://www.amazon.com/Weaving-Textiles-That-Shape-Themselves/dp/1847973191), or to create a form of weaving known as "[collapse weaving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwmMujRY_Dc)".  

### **Primary Measurements**

* **twists per inch:** the amount of twist applied to create the singles \(can also be expressed as a [twist angle](https://www.hjsstudio.com/twistangle.html)\). 
* **wraps per inch:** a measure of the width of the single calculated by winding around a one inch length at a neutral tension. 
* **denier:** describes the mass of a singles for a given length. Specifically, the number of grams per 9000 meters. a single strand of silk has a denier of 1, meaning that higher deniers carry more mass than silk and lower deniers are finer than silk. Anything with a denier less than than one is typically referred to as being made of "microfiber"
