# Prototyping Smart Textiles

//// THIS IS AN IN PROGRESS OPEN SOURCE TEXTBOOK -- CONTENT IS CHANGING EVERYDAY /////



Textiles are so ubiquitous within our built environment that we hardly seem to notice them. Yet, when we look more closely at our clothes, car seats, napkins, couch covers, blankets, rugs, curtains, and on and on, we see the outcome of almost 20,000 years of technological innovation. Look even more closely and you'll see textiles informing the infrastructure of modern computing, from the roped "fiber" that brings us the internet to the programmatic "threads" running processes on our computer. The term smart textiles has emerged over the past decade \(or so\) to describe textiles with electronics like sensors and actuators built directly into the textile structure at the level of individuals yarns. Yet, we can argue that smart textiles have existed much longer, perhaps even longer than recorded history as the very structures and fibers of textiles have always been designed to adapt the body to one's environment. Furthermore, metallic yarns have long been used to bring ornamental value to garments and the very components upon which our modern technical infrastructures have emerged are directly born from innovations in textiles. So, we want to begin by acknowledging that smart textiles are not new, though we may not have seen them before. With this in mind, this book aims to serve a resource that holds craft and technology, and history and the future, on equal footing. Craft and engineering are both processes of developing deep connections with materials. To envision the future, we often can look to and adapt from examples of the past. But first, lets acknowledge that those pasts are not so idyllic as common narratives of craft would have us believe. 

## Learning from the Problematic Histories of Both the Textiles and Electronics Industries

The histories of textiles are the histories of electronics insofar as textiles gave rise to modern computing. Specifically, the jacquard loom became inspiration for IBM's original machines for counting the census, as they operated on a binary logic physicalized in the form of punchcards. These then evolved and adapted into the computers we know today. But beyond computers, the structures of global communications systems, even the present day internet, relay on physical cables spun with materials like copper and fiber-optics in similar fashion to the yarns used in your clothing. The materials may have changed, but the techniques remain those of textiles. 

### Socio-Environmental Legacies of Textiles and Electro

In this framing, we also see many problems inherent in the textile industry carrying over into modern electronics manufacturing. Specifically, the "invisible labor" of millions of people who make our clothing and electronics, many of which don't offer the basic levels of safety or support for their workers \([source](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/business/global/07suicide.html), [source](https://theconversation.com/five-years-after-deadly-factory-fire-bangladeshs-garment-workers-are-still-vulnerable-88027)\). These practices are rooted in histories of slavery, where slaves were brought to the US in order to perform the work of picking cotton for textiles. "Southern cotton, picked and processed by American slaves, helped fuel the nineteenth-century Industrial Revolution in both the United States and Great Britain...By 1850, of the 3.2 million slaves in the \[US's\] fifteen slave states, 1.8 million were producing cotton; by 1860, slave labor was producing over two billion pounds of cotton per year" \([source](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-ushistory1os2xmaster/chapter/the-economics-of-cotton/#:~:text=By%201850%2C%20of%20the%203.2,and%20production%20continued%20to%20soar.)\). Many continue to refer to the textile industry, especially within the Global Souths, as "modern slavery" as the unsafe and force working conditions continue to produce the materials for Western brands \(see "[Tainted Garments](https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/the-invisible-women-and-girls-who-make-your-clothes/)"\). 

Environmentally, textiles \(and now electronics\) are primary sources of the world's waste, water usage and energy usage. A program for the [UN](https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/timber/meetings/2018/20180716/UN_Partnership_on_Sustainable_Fashion_programme_as_of_6-7-2018.pdf) [Partnership on Sustainable Fashion and SDGs](https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/timber/meetings/2018/20180716/UN_Partnership_on_Sustainable_Fashion_programme_as_of_6-7-2018.pdf) \(Sustainable Development Goals\) reports: "fashion is an environmental and social emergency. Nearly 20 percent of global waste water is produced by the fashion industry \(SDG 6\), which also emits about ten percent of global carbon emissions - more than the emissions of all international flights and maritime shipping combined \(SDG 13\). Cotton farming is responsible for 24 percent of insecticides and 11 percent of pesticides despite using only 3 percent of the world’s arable land \(SDG 3\)" These statistics report on fashion only, not considering the additional consumption of textiles for products like carpeting, upholstery, bedding, and so on and so forth. Now let's consider electronic waste, or e-waste. 

The 2020 report from the [Global E-Waste Monitor](https://globalewaste.org/) reports: "In 2019, approximately 53.6 million metric tons \(Mt\) of e-waste \(excluding PV panels\) was generated...the formal documented collection and recycling was 9.3 Mt, thus 17.4% compared to e-waste generated" and that in their predictions recycling activities "are not keeping pace with the global growth of e-waste." \([source](https://publications.globalewaste.org/v1/file/271/The-Global-E-waste-Monitor-2020-Quantities-flows-and-the-circular-economy-potential.pdf)\). 

### Legacies of Cultural Appropriation 

@steven to write this section 

### Socio-Cultural Legacies of Textiles and Electronics Labor

Textiles have long been associated with the of women and indigenous peoples. Anecdotal advice to hacklabs or other groups interested in involving girls and minority populations in computing include activities and sewing machines and textile crafts. This, in itself, is not problematic but sometimes people use these examples to suggest that girls and certain minorities just like or are better at textiles than boys. This wouldn't necessarily be problematic, again, until we see the differing levels of respect that are given to machines like 3D printers and sewing machines and looms \(which are amazing!\).

Historically, we see something more complicated showing how women were often forced into textiles work, even when they may have desired other tasks. This existed even in prestigious institutions like the Bauhaus, as the studios for painting were reserved for men. Craft, or the know-how of making, was relegated to women and "amateurs" and also seen as less valuable than the production of art by geniuses, visionaries, and "experts." We see similar divides taking place in computing, whether in "Letting the Computer Boys take over" where women "computers" were replaced and devalued by male "coders" who scripted the algorithms that were enacted by the women. Other histories, such as Lisa Nakamura's [Indiginous Circuits](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/563663) and Daniela Rosner's [Critical Fabulations](http://criticalfabulations.com/) trace this into contemporary life, demonstrating the way that women were only given options to do certain kind of textile-related work, which was, at once,  devalued _and_ used in commercial materials to appeal to the material's "hand crafted" nature when selling the product. 

Within this frame, it is also important to acknowledge the work of many women \(and some not\) and artists  in forming the foundation upon which modern smart textile products have been built \(and who have personally inspired me\). Folks like Joanna Berzowska, Maggie Orth, Hannah-Perner Wilson, Leah Buechley, Mika Satomi, all those at E-textiles Summer Camp and E-Textiles Spring Break, who have been committed to keeping their work public and open source. And to the many many many others that I am not mentioning by name, thank you. While the media may have us believe that tech giants are inventing the future of smart materials and textiles, the past two decades of work have largely been pioneered outside industry brainstorming sessions and engineering institutions. Textile craft and electronics craft are equally valuable in the formation of innovative and sustainable products,[ we should give practitioners of either or both the same kinds of opportunities and credit](http://unstable.design/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chi20c-sub9178-cam-i16-2.pdf). 

## Suggestions for Decolonizing your E-Textiles / Smart Textiles Prototyping

Ultimately, this is a book for prototyping smart textiles, which as we have acknowledged, has many many problematic histories and presents. Yet, we want to acknowledge that this practice can be valuable and we need people to invent and envision the futures for these kinds of things, while remaining mindful and knowledgable of their histories. We want to be hopeful for better futures \(though this is difficult at times\) and hope you will be to. In that vein, we want to offer some suggestions for prototyping while maintaining a critical focus on the socio-enviromental challenges. Here we want to draw on work of Kavita Philip, Lilly Irani and Paul Dourish to highlight the ways we might push towards a "[postcolonial computing](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0162243910389594)" practice. Their text offers a series of tactics to consider during your prototyping to help guide your work which I have summarized and applied specifically to smart textiles below \(asking forgiveness for possible errors in my translation and adaption: 

Tactic 1: When we see a smart textile, we investigate the many forms of labor and access that allowed it to come to be. Who was able to be in the room when the concept was developed, who had the capital to see it through, whose labor was assumed to be available when articulating the concept, who gets to claim authorship of the technique?

Tactic 2: When we see the term smart textiles, we ask what it means to be "smart", who has the authority to give it that term."

_"Tactic 3: When we see claims of inherent technological and cultural difference, we apply STS methods symmetrically to both the technology and the culture at hand. But we do not stop there; we proceed to deconstruct the binary between technology and culture and study the impure crossings between them. When we see an instance of indigenous science or ‘‘native’’ technology, we investigate it not as an instance of inherent difference or autochthonous authenticity but as a practice with the same epistemological status as putatively Western sciences. In other words, our categories, while always subject to grounded interrogation and theoretical critique, emerge from assumptions of diachronic imbrication rather than synchronic incommensurability."_





























The term smart textiles has emerged over the past decade \(or so\) to describe textiles with electronics like sensors and actuators built directly into the textile structure at the level of individuals yarns. The term is misleading because it implies that new technologies have made once "dumb" textiles now intelligent and responsive when in fact, the very structures and fibers of textiles have always been designed to adapt the body to one's environment.  What so-called "smart" materials add to this mix is a set of new design possibilities, of both aesthetic and function, that holds interest and value to multiple fields of practice: from engineers, to craftspeople, to fashion houses, to global telecom networks. 

This book is intended for the smart textiles researcher who is new to the field, and is curious to know more about the processes and levels of textile construction at which they could intervene. For those in textiles or textile engineering, it may provide more information about how metallic and otherwise non-traditional materials can be integrated into these structures in order to provide the capacity for sensing or actuation. 

To honor the many disciplines and ways-of-knowing that come together when experimenting with textiles, we are writing this with an eye towards honoring electronics, materials engineering, and textile crafts/fiber arts as practices of working with and developing deep relationships with materials and the human \(and nonhuman\) ability to "tease form out of those materials." For the experienced weaver or spinner, this text might help provide a new framework and set of experiments to add to your practice, for instance, by considering the specific electrical capacities of different kinds of yarn in addition to their twist and knit quality. We will introduce entry level concepts and applications for experimenting with these materials. 

As an author, I belong to both and neither categories \(as you the reader might identify as well\), so many places will focus on ways of playing around with ideas informally when you simply don't have the skills or access to the equipment you need. While many technical narratives treat craft as mere labor or know-how, we hope to inspire an appreciation of those who have cultivated the skill and technique that many engineering problems so desperately need in order to achieve robust products that use textile materials' inherent structures and functions to perform work otherwise delegated to batteries and computation cycles. 

What we offer here is largely guided through the experiences of those working in the Unstable Design Lab. It is a guidebook for exploring textile structures specifically with the integration of  conductive, biological, or otherwise "experimental" materials in mind. If you want to make some kind of smart, e-textile, soft robotic or flexible electronic project utilizing textile structures and methods, this is for you.
