# Purpose of Research
The purpose of this research is to find a reliable method of dyeing fiber with thermochromic pigments. Thermochromic dyes already exist in the market, however, the color intensity often leaves something to be desired. (add photos of control vs commercial dyed fiber) So for this research my metrics are how do I create a color-intense dye that stays on the fabric while still changing color?

Metrics:
Color intensity
Color fastness
Color change
