A braid is a structure that is created by interlacing singles, plied yarns and/or filaments in a flat, but more often, tubular structure. The most noticeable difference between a plied structure and a braided one is that the braid requires materials to travel in two directions around a center point. A tubular braid is a hollow structure and can be left hollow for particular applications and has particularly good mechanical properties for [artificial muscles](https://softroboticstoolkit.com/book/pneumatic-artificial-muscles). These are created because, with slippery materials, the braid will increase its cross-sectional diameter when compressed, and narrow when stretched \(a tubular scissor linkage\).

Yet, we often find braiding as a method of adding strength around a core, for instance, in the creation of climbing rope or as a decorative "shell" for a mundane appliance cord. The advantage to braiding is that it makes it slightly easier to combine several different materials \(e.g. conductive and non-conductive materials\) as you have a bit more control over tension within braiding than you do with spinning.

Braiding can be performed with in [spun](plied-yarn.md) yarn, [filament](filament.md), or even more complex structures such as knitted cord, as I found when I was disassembling some old shoelaces:

### Primary Measurements:

Because of the multitude of factors that can be used in a braid, I do not know of any standard measurement across all applications. Measurements of braided rope or cord express the measurements of the various components involved. For instance, I found this set of measurements for parachute cord online:

Diameter of approximately 4.0mm \(5/32‚Äù\)  
7 - 2 ply cabled inner nylon strands  
Nylon 32 strand woven outer sheath

This tells me inside of the braid there are 7 individual nylon strands each having a 2-ply structure. I'm assuming that 32 individual strands of nylon are then used to braid the outer sheath.
