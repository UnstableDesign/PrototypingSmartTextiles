A filament is a fiber of unlimited or very long length. Filaments are typically produced through [extrusion](../process/extruding-3d-printing.md), are of uniform length and quality. Silk is said to be a natural filament because it can be harvested in single lengths that are very long. Other common filaments include [copper](../materials/metallic-fibers.md#copper) magnet wire, [nylon](../materials/synthetic-fibers.md#nylon), and [rayon](../materials/synthetic-fibers.md#rayon). Because of their uniform structure, they can often be very light and strong. 

filaments are available as monofilaments or multifilaments. Monofilaments refer to a single continuous length of filament where multifilaments consist of several filaments [twisted](../process/plying/) or [braided](../process/braiding.md) together.

### **Primary Measurements**

* **type:** the source of the filament
* **fiber diameter:** the cross-sectional diameter of the fiber, measured in Âµm or [AWG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wire_gauge)
