# Core Spun Yarn

Core spun yarns describe a multi-layered yarn structure where fiber is spun around a single continuous filament in the core. This is a common technique for creating conductive yarns. The internal material is referred to as the core, and the outer is referred to as the sheath. There is a seemingly endless combination and set of techniques for constructing core spun yarns, which you can find [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/core-spun-yarn).
