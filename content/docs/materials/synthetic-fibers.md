# Synthetic Fibers

Synthetic fibers are made from chemical solutions, such a polymer solutions, that are [extruded](../process/extruding-3d-printing.md) and cured or otherwise formed into [filaments](../structure/filament.md). Sometimes these are cut to produce [staple fibers](../structure/staple-fiber.md). Synthetic fibers are engineered to provide interesting properties \([such as piezoelectric effects](https://www.intechopen.com/books/piezoelectricity-organic-and-inorganic-materials-and-applications/piezoelectric-melt-spun-textile-fibers-technological-overview)\) and/or to mimic the properties of existing materials at a lower cost, such as the case of nylon, which was originally branded as "artificial silk."

## Nylon 

Nylon was invented by DuPont chemical and is created using a coal and crude oil bi-product. It is a [thermoplastic](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+a+thermoplastic&oq=what+is+a+thermoplastic&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.3807j1j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Due to its strength and fineness, it was commonly used in stockings and such. It can also be incredibly strong and is often used in ropes, such as climbing ropes. Nylon can be produced in various compositions, so you may see it labeled as Nylon 6 or Nylon66, describing the specific chemical makeup \(and shaping particular behaviors\). For instance, nylon66 as been shown to have piezoelectric effects.

## Rayon

Rayon is a synthetic fiber that a form of "regenerated cotton." Specifically, it is processed from wood pulp.

## Acrylic

Acrylic is another polymer based yarn that contains at least 85% [acrylonitrile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylonitrile) [monomer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomer). It is commonly found in fabric shops in a wide range of bright colors and textures.
