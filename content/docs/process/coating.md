# Coating / Painting / Printing

A method for adding some material or texture onto a material structure. Often by immersing and dying in a bath or spraying.  Painting can be seen as a process of coating, whereby pigments are applied to the surface of the structure. Other processes of coating include mercerization, whereby chemical processes are applied to change the chemical properties of the material in the structure.
