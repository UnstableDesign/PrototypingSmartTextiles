# Dying / Resists

Dying is a surface application for structures that imbues them with particular color patterns and characteristics. Dying requires a chemical bond to form between a fiber and the dye compound. This chemical bond is what makes something a dye, rather than a [paint](coating.md), which is made from pigment and is attached to the surface of a material via a medium. Dyes typically produce a softer hand than painted yarns. Resists describe materials you can add to a material that protects that area from absorbing dye. As such, the two processes are related.
