# Spinning Wheel Spinning

The most common method of spinning requires a spinning wheel \(yes, the machine of fairy tale lore\), which requires a substantial amount of technique and know how to use it effectively. A spinning wheel requires the spinner to use their feet to spin the wheel at an even pace and both their hands to draw the fibers into the wheel. It is faster and produces higher quality yarn than the other techniques.
