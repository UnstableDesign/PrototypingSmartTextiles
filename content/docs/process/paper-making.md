### Techniques for Creating Yarns from Paper

Many people create textiles from paper-based yarns, simply by spinning or cutting individual sheets of [newspaper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKAnC1cW6zA) and/or [toilet paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6qgfdv2KsI). Both of those techniques are a bit hacked but these techniques have been refined over centuries, particularly within Japan. This paper/thread is created from a material called [kozo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qm8WPhowKwk) and developed into paper fabric called [shifu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtQFB1Ztb84).
