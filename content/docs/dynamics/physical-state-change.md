artificial muscles

Lets start with a [McKibben artificial muscle](https://softroboticstoolkit.com/book/pneumatic-artificial-muscles#:~:text=The%20muscles%20consist%20of%20an,radial%20expansion%20into%20linear%20contraction.) which consists of a rope that is braided around a ****hollow tube. When you pressurize the fluid \(air or water\) in the tube, the braided structure amplifies the movement. In most DIY examples, we see these made by simply buying a pre-made braided hollow cord and shoving a hollow tube down the center of it.

## Color Change 

### Thermochromic

 [Maggie Orth](http://www.maggieorth.com/art_100EAYears.html) and others beginning in 2009 and we played around with integrating the yarns in various stitches to see what kinds of effects we could come up with.
