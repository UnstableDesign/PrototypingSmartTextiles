# Traces

A trace is a conductive material that carries electricity from one location in your circuit to another. In traditional electronics, your traces are usually [insulated](insulation.md) wires with uninsulated tips that you plug into a breadboard or solder to a controller. 

In soft electronics traces can be created from a single thread traveling through a material, a conductive fabric or paint fused to the surface of a fabric or a single thread of material integrated into a knit or woven fabric. They are attached through more inventive [connection](connections.md) methods. 

Most "smart" features of garments are created by remaking existing sensors and actuators using traces alone - as traces configured in particular patterns \(spirals, etc\) can produce emergent properties such as magnetism, etc. Traces typically are produced from highly conductive materials like copper and can be integrated with any number of processes from bonding, plating, etching, fusing, knitting, weaving, etc. 


## Traces
When thinking about circuit traces in textiles you can consider using flexible metal wires or threads like the following: 
- [30 AWG silicone coated wires](https://www.amazon.com/BNTECHGO-Silicone-Flexible-Resistant-Insulation/dp/B01M70EDCW/ref=sr_1_12?crid=1R6D4MFI6V116&keywords=32+awg+silicone+wire&qid=1664763990&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjk0IiwicXNhIjoiMi41MiIsInFzcCI6IjIuMTQifQ%3D%3D&s=industrial&sprefix=32+awg+silicone+wir%2Cindustrial%2C109&sr=1-12). These are thin, flexible, highly conductive, and easy to sew or weave. They also come in many different colors. Cost effective.
- [28AWG - 30AWG magnet wire](https://www.amazon.com/Magnet-Enameled-Copper-Winding-Crafts/dp/B019GQ5FBM). This has thin enamel coating that is clear. It's thick enough to work with, but thin enough to be flexible. Anything thinner breaks too easily. Its very conductive. 
- [Karl Grimm Copper or Silver Thread](http://karl-grimm.de/). Much harder to get and uninsulated but highly conductive and solderable. 
- [Stainless Steel Yarn](https://www.bart-francis.be/en/etextile-high-technology-yarn-and-co/e-textile-metal-sewing-embroidery-special-7-5nm-2ply-33gram-240mt/a-5829-128). Hard to get in the US (requires EU shipping address) but good quality stainless threads and yarns. 

If you find some other yarns you'd like to use that say they are metallic, be sure to check them with a multimeter first to ensure they are actually conductive enough for what you need. The video belows gives you more tips and resources how to do this

## General Strategies to Integrating Traces into Textiles
When thinking about how you might integrate traces into woven or knitting structures, you can consider the condutive yarn as a kind of pattern element that you need to pattern in a particular way. Specifically, you need a single yarn to form a path from one spot in your textile to the next. There are a number of ways to do this, which we highlight below.

### 1. Consider the size Ratios between Conductive and Non-Conductive Yarns.

*The "Simple" Approach*: If your conductive yarns or threads are very thin and your non-conductive much thicker (as is often the case) consider integrating the conductive as a supplemental material in certain regions of the pattern. In knitting, this means simply carrying the conductive along with the base yarn and knitting the two yarns at once as seen in Irene Posch's [Early Winter Night Biking Gloves](http://www.ireneposch.net/early-winter-night-biking-gloves/). In weaving, this means throwing two materials in a pic at once (your conductive and non-conductive) in the regions where the material is required following an inlay techniques:

Below, you can see each segment of a seven segment display embedded using inlay technique. 


*The Advanced Approach*: Pick a base non-conductive yarn that is just as thin as your conductive and integrate it only in the required regions. In knitting, this can be achieved with techinques similar to intasia:

 This tecnique and used by Irene Posch with the [Knitted Capacitor](https://etextile-summercamp.org/swatch-exchange/knitted-capacitor/). In weaving, this select placement of two materials along the weft requires time-expensive weft interchanges where the condtuctive and non-conductive yarns are manually worked across a portion of the cloth width.
