      <description>Hand Knitting # Hand knitting takes place with knitting needles, manipulated by the hands. This technique allows for playful discovery of stitches and structures and, depending on the kind of needle, can be used to knit surfaces, tubes, or volumes. The material, gauge, stitch, and needle size all shift the texture of the knit itself, giving way to more stretchy, bully, light, or rigid textures. Textures in handknitting can change at any point in the process across the surface by changing the stitch.</description>

      <description>Machine Knitting # There are two main types of knitting machines that can used for tabletop knitting. These machines are made possible through &amp;ldquo;latchhook needles.&amp;rdquo; A flat bed machine, comes in two &amp;lsquo;gauges&amp;rsquo;, standard and chunky. The gauge of the machine refers to the spacing between the needles in the bed of the machine, which allows for different size yarns to run through the machine. These machines can be programmed electronically, or via punchcard.</description>
