      <description>Hand Sewing # While we offer a few different techniques below, there are excellent tutorials focused on sewing circuits. For instance, Spark Fun offers a great intro to Sewing to a Lilypad Arduino. Below, we offer a more generalized introduction with a focus on the different stitches you might choose to use and how they can be useful within e-textiles. If you are interested in a broader set of techniques, such as pleating or sewing patterns, I enjoyed the resources provided by Colleen G Lea on the Fashion Sewing YouTube Channel.</description>

      <description>Machine Sewing # There are various kind of machine sewing, each one used for different applications. Below, we&amp;rsquo;ll just focus on conventional sewing machines (as opposed to serger, cover-stitch, or embroidery machines)
Conventional Sewing Machines # A conventional sewing machine typically has one top stitching thread (pulled from on top of the machine) and one bobbin (used to secure the backside of the fabric). The two threads work together to find your fabrics.</description>
