      <description>Bonding / Laser Welding # Bonding is process of using heat or other adhesives to fuse two layers of material or multiple structures together. It works though the magic of fusible interfacings, fabric materials that contain adhesives that &amp;ldquo;glue&amp;rdquo; fabrics together when heated. Basically, conductive fabrics and interfacing can be cut in the same patterns and fused, to create functional systems and circuits such as these examples below. A key point to make, highlighted in the work below, is to ensure that your interfacing has an open-enough mesh for any conductive layers to make contact with one another, if that is the property you are looking for</description>

      <description>Braiding # Braiding is a technique that uses coils multiple strands, in different twist directions around a solid or hollow core. Industrial braiding uses a machine called a &amp;ldquo;maypole machine&amp;rdquo; that is utterly fascinating to watch. Braiding is often used for creating sheaths around a core. What is nice about braiding is you can have a core that is a completely different material than the sheath without having to wrestle with too many different issues in tensioning.</description>

      <description>Coating / Painting / Printing # A method for adding some material or texture onto a material structure. Often by immersing and dying in a bath or spraying. Painting can be seen as a process of coating, whereby pigments are applied to the surface of the structure. Other processes of coating include mercerization, whereby chemical processes are applied to change the chemical properties of the material in the structure.</description>

      <description>Combing and Carding # Carding yarns arranges the fibers in multiple directions and is referred to as a &amp;ldquo;woolen&amp;rdquo; preparation of fibers. Carding fibers produces roving. Fibers of all different lengths are kept in this process. The goal of carding is to build up enough of a &amp;ldquo;mesh&amp;rdquo; of fibers that they hold together. These meshes, and the process, yields more airy, fluffy and soft yarns. Bundles of woolen fibers are most often called &amp;ldquo;roving&amp;rdquo; but you different preparations go by names batts, rolags, fauxlags, puin, cloud, and wool locks, each of which offers, as you expect, its own set of unique qualities to the fibers.</description>

      <description>Dying / Resists # Dying is a surface application for structures that imbues them with particular color patterns and characteristics. Dying requires a chemical bond to form between a fiber and the dye compound. This chemical bond is what makes something a dye, rather than a paint, which is made from pigment and is attached to the surface of a material via a medium. Dyes typically produce a softer hand than painted yarns.</description>

      <description>Electroplating # Most conductive yarns and threads are created by electroplating polymer materials such as nylon. Electroplating is a process of using electrically charged solutions to bound metallic substances to the surface of a structure. There are rules about which materials will plate to others (somewhere?), but the brave souls of YouTube have tried to show us how to do electroplating at home with household materials.

      <description>Embroidery # embroidery is a surface application technique applied to existing fabrics. It is similar to and often used in conjunction with sewing, bit focuses much more on the application of threads to the surface of a fabric for decorative and/or functional purposes.

      <description>Extruding / 3D Printing # Extruding # A second common process uses processes of extrusion. In these cases, materials are processed into a liquid like goo (think play-doh) and pressed through narrow openings named after a spider&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;spinneret.&amp;rdquo; The single streams of material emerging from the spinneret are either spun directly into fiber or deposited into liquid chemical baths as part of their structural formation. Often, extruding gives rise to filaments, where long continuous fibers are created.</description>

      <description>Felting # a process of creating non-wovens that directly tangles fibers to create a fabric.
Needle Felting # Needle felting binds fibers to themselves or to a textile surface through the stabbing or a barbed needle repeatedly through the fabric. This technique can be used for creating surfaces as well as shapes, can create objects entirely out of fibers and/or to add texture/interactivity to the surface of a fabric.</description>

Structure Ability to be Grown Ability to be initegrated into Growth Processes or Grown Upon? Raw Fiber sure yes? Filament yes yes? Roving &amp;amp; Top no, I don&amp;rsquo;t think you could directly grow rowing hummm Singles no, I don&amp;rsquo;t think you could directly grow singles, though something similar could be yes?</description>
