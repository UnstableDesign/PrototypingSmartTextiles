To help this, we have attempted to put information about each fiber in a common space. These, however, are incredibly general as some measurements (e.g. resistivity) will vary greatly on the specific preparation of the material for use in a textile.\nIf you would like to review all the data in one common location, you can visit this Google Spreadsheet we put together. Kobakant also has an amazing resource about the different constructions and comparisons for materials and yarns as well: https://www.kobakant.at/DIY/?p=8012\nWe have organized this information within fiber groups and across fiber groups where it makes sense. Because of the different sourcing traditions of textile fibers and things like conductive materials, it was not always possible to find information that was comparable across cases. The specific qualities I included are as follows:\nGeneral Measures # Staple Length: # for staple fibers, this describes the range of lengths available for each fiber. Measured in millimeters. Staple length is usually given in a range. In the chart below, we plotted the minimum possible staple length - showing linen to be the shortest and silk, by far, to be the longest. Longer staple length fibers require less individual fibers in spinning (allowing them to be finer). This measure is somewhat irrelevant for synthetic fibers, which are extruded and cut into any length.\nFiber Diameter: # For staple fibers, this describes the range of widths for each fiber type and its measured in microns. The chart below shows the minimum diameter possible for each fiber, with silk being the finest and worsted wool being the most coarse. The finer the fiber, the lighter and finer the yarn. This number is somewhat irrelevant for filaments, which can be extruded at different diameters depending on the equipment used.\nMoisture Regain # Moisture regain is a measure of how much moisture the fiber can absorb and still feel dry to the touch.The chart below shows both the low and high range of moisture regain measured across natural and synthetic fibers. The chart below shows that natural fibers have better regain than synthetics do not. I was not able to find this information for metals more generally.\nCrimp # The level of crimp in staple fibers imbues them with the ability to be spun easily and hold air. To indicate if the fiber is crimped or not, we simply indicate yes or no. Wool is naturally crimped and some synthetics are given a crimp to aid in different textures. For metallics, it was harder to find out but in working with stainless I find the texture (of stainless fibers) to be very \u0026ldquo;grabby\u0026rdquo; or barbed, which indicates to me that it might bend and hold a kind of crimped structure.\nSuperfine Wool Worsted Wool Cotton Linen Silk Nylon Rayon (Viscose) Acrylic Silver Copper Stainless Crimp: Yes Yes No No No can be added can be added can be added no? no? yes? Electrical Measures # Resistivity # Is the inverse of conductivity and expresses how resistive a material is (generally). The specific resistance of your material will always depend on its preparation (e.g. width, length, temperature, humidity, etc. so these are only to be considered in comparison to each-other. The chart below shows resistivity across all materials in our collection. The log scale on the y-axis should be noted and was used to keep very large values on the same graph. Metallic materials has much more consistent measures of resistivity where natural fibers like cotton and linen did not (or I made up a number based on information that it was \u0026lsquo;more\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;less\u0026quot; resistive than another). Because natural fibers absorb water and hold more air in their structures, they have exhibit dramatic changes in resistivity.\nSuperfine Wool Worsted Wool Cotton Linen Silk Nylon Rayon (Viscose) Acrylic Silver Copper Stainless Resistivity (2.0 ± 0.1)x10^6 (2.0 ± 0.1)x10^6 9.53×10^9 said to be higher than cotton and wool insulator when dry 3.6*10^11 1.59x10^-8 1.68×10^−8 6.9×^10−7 Anti-Static # Static refers to the ability for the material to build up a charge and seem to correlate to how thermally conductive the material is. Wool is said to be naturally anti-static where silk can build up a charge. This depends on the chemical makeup as well as the moisture holding ability of each fiber. Metals are anti-static in that they are highly conductive, moving charges readily through their structure instead of allowing electrons to collect on the surface. Static also causes clothing to \u0026ldquo;cling.\u0026rdquo;\nSuperfine Wool Worsted Wool Cotton Linen Silk Nylon Rayon (Viscose) Acrylic Silver Copper Stainless Anti-Static Yes Yes ? ? Poor in Dry Conditions, Good in Wet unsure unsure Good Good Good Good # Thermal Conductivity # Thermal conductivity describes how easily heat moves through the material. Wool has low thermal conductivity because it can hold heat within its structure (radiating warmth in cold weather or keeping you cool in hot weather). A material with low thermal conductivity will feel warm to the touch (like wool). A material with high conductivity will keep you cool and may feel cool to the touch (like linen).\nSuperfine Wool Worsted Wool Cotton Linen Silk Nylon Rayon (Viscose) Acrylic Silver Copper Thermal Conductivity Poor - 0.04 (W/m K) Poor - 0.04 (W/m K) Good Higest (heat resistant - feels cool to touch, does not melt) Poor OK 406 (W/m K) 385 (W/m K) Other Measures # Fire Resistance # This describes how resistant the material is to fire, or the temperature at which it burns. Some materials (e.g. synthetics) never burn, but melt. Wool has fire resistant properties where linen will burn like a match.\nUV Resistance # I see this describing two qualities in my search: how much UV degrades the structure (e.g. sun exposure will break down silk), and how much UV is able to penetrate the fiber. It was difficult to disentangle the measures so they are likely to be compounded below.\nAnti-Microbial # This describes how readily microbes can grow within the fiber. Not available for all materials and we included below as either \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;poor.\u0026rdquo; Of metallic fibers, Silver is often said to be anti-microbial (and anti-odor) but its unclear if this is also true for copper and stainless.\nMoisture Wicking # This is the ability for a fiber to move moisture into its structure and to dry quickly. Wool and synthetics can be moisture wicking and cotton is not.\nMoisture Absorbant # This refers to how much moisture the fiber can absorb. Its mostly related to weight and how much weight in water the material can take on. A fiber can be both wicking and absorbing but the two entities are not distinctly related.\nDry Strength \u0026amp; Wet Strength # Some fibers perform differently wet than dry. For instance, wool if very strong when dry and very weak when wet (hence no machine washing). Cotton, on the other hand, is stronger when its wet than dry. We include these as general measures and they most closely correspond to machine-washability.\nSuperfine Wool Worsted Wool Cotton Linen Silk Nylon Rayon (Viscose) Acrylic Silver Copper Stainless Fire Resistance Good Good Very Poor OK (but melts) Poor, Burns UV Resistance Good Good Poor Poor UV Weakens Fibers Great Anti-Microbial Good Good Poor Good ? Moisture Wicking Good Good Poor Good Good Moisture Absorbant Good Good Good Poor Dry Strength Good Good Good Great Good Great Poor Wet Strength Poor Poor Better Better Great Poor Sustainability Measures # There were so many measures we could have included here but we found it difficult to find comparative information across the ones we included. Other factors that affect sustainability are the region of growth, the need for pesticides, the water use for growing, as well as the water and chemical use often used to process the fibers into a usable form. Another factor are the sourcing of the materials. For instance, bamboo from \u0026ldquo;managed forests\u0026rdquo; can be seen as more sustainable than bamboo that is harvested (and not replanted). In the chart, we include general measures about renewability and biodegradability (and all measures assume the material is undyed, untreated with coating or chemical treatments). The general trend shows that natural fibers are renewable and biodegradable in shorter spans than synthetic materials. However all these features depend on the particular environmental factors affecting the biodegrading. My my personal opinion, I tend to hold wools and linens in my mind as more sustainable due to their availability and yield. For linen especially, the low water use is a bonus.\nSuperfine Wool Worsted Wool Cotton Linen Silk Nylon Rayon (Viscose) Acrylic Silver Copper Stainless Renewable Resource Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes No ?

Credit: Rob / CC BY\nA fiber is one of primary building blocks of textiles, it describe a material with a high length to width ratio. A staple fiber has a limited length while filaments have unlimited length. Staple fibers are categorized into categories based on their source and chemical properties:\nNatural fibers are those that come from animals and plants. The size and length of staple fiber thus depends on what can be grown and harvested.\nProtein fibers are harvested from animals (sheep, goats, alpaca) and insects (spiders, caterpillars). Cellulose fibers are sourced from plants (linen, cotton, etc). Many of these are considered \u0026ldquo;bast\u0026rdquo; fibers which derive from the long fibrous structures within the stem. Synthetic fibers are often created from polymer solutions. They are made into long filaments through processes of extrusion, then cured or otherwise hardened into a continuous material. Synthetic staple fibers are then made by cutting the longer filaments into shorter pieces.\nMetallic fibers are a category we have added to include conductive yarns into this resource. Some metals can be shaped into the form of staple fibers through processes of shredding or rolling into filaments and cutting.\nStaple fibers are prepared and given twist to turn them into yarns. In other cases, they are entangled directly to make fabric, without passing through the yarn state. When made into yarn, their structure (lots of little fibers tangled in a row) often provides them with the ability to hold air and stretch. As such, yarns made from staple fibers may feel softer and springier than yarns made from a continuous filaments.\nPrimary Measurements # type: the source of the fiber staple length: the length of the fiber, measured in mm fiber diameter: the cross-sectional diameter of the fiber, measured in µm crimp: the overall shape of the fiber, some have kinks and crimps "},{"id":3,"href":"/docs/structure/","title":"Structure","section":"Docs","content":" What are Structures # All textiles are based from fibers which, through successive processes, are converted into multidimensional structures.

National Archives and Records Administration / Public domain\nA filament is a fiber of unlimited or very long length. Filaments are typically produced through extrusion, are of uniform length and quality. Silk is said to be a natural filament because it can be harvested in single lengths that are very long. Other common filaments include copper magnet wire, nylon, and rayon. Because of their uniform structure, they can often be very light and strong.\nfilaments are available as monofilaments or multifilaments. Monofilaments refer to a single continuous length of filament where multifilaments consist of several filaments twisted or braided together.\nPrimary Measurements # type: the source of the filament fiber diameter: the cross-sectional diameter of the fiber, measured in µm or AWG "},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/materials/protein-fibers/","title":"Protein","section":"Materials","content":" Protein Fibers # Wool # Wool fiber is harvested from animals, such as sheep, goats and alpaca, and can be obtained in many different grades that make it softer, more brash, etc. for different purposes. When the word \u0026ldquo;wool\u0026rdquo; is used, it is typically referring to sheeps wool. Typically, wools with shorter and finer staple lengths (like cashmere or merino) are carded into woolen yarns for exceptional softness. Longer staple fibers are used for more durable applications. Wool is often noted for its unique \u0026ldquo;crimped\u0026rdquo; structure, elasticity, and durability (in the sense that you can bend the fibers lots and they don\u0026rsquo;t break). The little crimps or barbs of the wool fiber, make it hold really nicely to other fibers when it is spun into yarn, also making it a bit more durable (as long as it isn\u0026rsquo;t wet). Because of these crimps, wool fibers line up in yarn with little pockets of air between them. These little air pockets give it is insulating qualities and heat and cold can\u0026rsquo;t easily move through the contained little air pockets. It is naturally fire resistant (to some degree). Additionally, the cellular makeup of wool makes it particularly good at \u0026ldquo;wicking\u0026rdquo; moisture and absorbing it.‌\nImage Source: https://archive.org/details/cu31924031496833\n\u0026ldquo;Wool fibers are made up of cortical cells, and these cells are wrapped in cuticle. This scaly outer layer is then covered by yet another layer, the epicuticle \u0026ndash; a filmy skin that helps to repel moisture. What\u0026rsquo;s more, the epicuticle also helps out in high humidity because it has tiny pores that draw in the moisture vapor to the center of the fiber where it\u0026rsquo;s absorbed by a chemical process. The hydrogen bond of water, H2O, is actually broken, creating a chemical reaction with the wool fiber molecules to generate heat when it has taken on a lot of moisture. But because the air pockets allow moisture to evaporate from your skin, you won\u0026rsquo;t overheat when you sweat.\u0026rdquo; [Source]\n​‌\nImage Source: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CSIRO_ScienceImage_2490_Schematic_for_Wool_Fibre.jpg​‌\nI have heard that wool can absorb 30% of its weight in water and still remain dry to the touch. This keeps the body cool and dry, and also allows wool to have natural anti-static properties, meaning it won\u0026rsquo;t cling to your skin and, in terms of electronics, won\u0026rsquo;t build up charge. The elasticity of wool means that it can hold its shape (or have \u0026ldquo;memory\u0026rdquo;) better than other fibers, as long as it isn\u0026rsquo;t wet.\nHarvesting # Wool is harvested by sheering the animal to obtain the fleece, cleaning the fleece (to clean off the oils) and then processing into your desired structure.\nHow Its Made Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsRxMsBGuFs More processing Details from Woolmark: https://www.woolmark.com/about-wool/wool-processing/ Popular Varieties # Merino Wool Super Soft and Springy https://www.smartwool.com/discover/what-is-merino-wool.html Alpaca Also very Soft and Fine https://www.peruvianconnection.com/category/fiber+and+product+information/alpaca+fiber.do Cashmere Taken from the downy undercoat of goats and made into super soft and warm products https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ5q0TVD0aM Sourcing # Structure Possibility to Source in this Structure Fiber Easy Roving Easy Plied Yarn Easy Braided Rope unsure Filament impossible Knit Easy Woven Easy Non-Woven Easy, Sold as Felt Silk # Silk is a protein fiber that is harvested from the cocoons of silk worms.

Mulberry silk comes from the domesticated species \u0026ldquo;bombyx mori” and is a bit finer and of higher quality as it comes from a very specific breed of worm whose diet consists only of mulberry leaves. Tussah silk comes from a variety of species who live wild largely in South Asia and has a denser and more fibrous structure.\nThe general structure of wool (the cross-section) is roughly triangular with curved corners.

Credit: Lisa Dusseault on Flickr\nRoving and or Top describe fibers that have been given and initial structure to hold them together, but have not yet been given any twist. These are produced by processes of combing or carding individual fibers into into a common direction prior to spinning. Typically, carding fibers entangling them in multiple directions (think a dreadlock). Collections of fibers prepared in this fashion referred to as \u0026ldquo;woolen\u0026rdquo; and sold under the name roving. Thus, roving adds a springy and airy quality to a yarn when it is spun. Alternatively, some fibers are prepared through combing (like a pony tail) which aligns the individual fibers in a single direction and often removes fibers of unusual length. Fibers prepared by combing are called \u0026ldquo;worsted\u0026rdquo; and sold as top. Worsted preparations tend to produce stronger and denser yarns when they are spun.\nThere are several products sold on the market such as \u0026ldquo;carbon roving\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;glass roving\u0026rdquo; that describe strands of continuous filaments laying mostly parallel to each other. These are structurally very different than roving made from staple fibers but share the quality of being the preparation before twist is added.\nPrimary Measurements # type: the plant or breed of the combed/carded fiber\nstaple length: the average staple length of the fibers within the roving (when applicable)\nyield: the number of yards of roving per pound.\nbecause roving and top can easily be pulled to cut or twisted back into their structure, the length of the roving/top itself is less important.

In traditional electronics, your traces are usually insulated wires with uninsulated tips that you plug into a breadboard or solder together.\nIn soft electronics traces can be created from a single thread traveling through a material, a conductive fabric or paint fused to the surface of a fabric or a single thread of material integrated into a knit or woven structure. Traces are attached through more inventive connection methods.\nMost \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; features of garments are created by remaking existing sensors and actuators using traces alone - as traces configured in particular patterns (spirals, coils, etc) can produce emergent properties such as magnetism, etc.\nMaking Traces # When thinking about circuit traces in textiles you can consider using flexible metal wires or threads like the following:\n30 AWG silicone coated wires. These are thin, flexible, highly conductive, and easy to sew or weave. They also come in many different colors. Cost effective. 28AWG - 30AWG magnet wire. This has thin enamel coating that is clear. It\u0026rsquo;s thick enough to work with, but thin enough to be flexible. Anything thinner breaks too easily. Its very conductive. Karl Grimm Copper or Silver Thread. Much harder to get and uninsulated but highly conductive and solderable. Stainless Steel Yarn. Hard to get in the US (requires EU shipping address) but good quality stainless threads and yarns. We have selected this list focusing on materials that have low resistances, because, in general traces in a circuit should move as much electricity as possible. If you find some other yarns you\u0026rsquo;d like to use that say they are metallic, be sure to check them with a multimeter first to ensure they are actually conductive enough for what you need. The video belows gives you more tips and resources how to do this:\nGeneral Strategies to Integrating Traces into Textiles # When thinking about how you might integrate traces into woven or knitting structures, you can consider the condutive yarn as a kind of pattern element that you need to pattern in a particular way. Specifically, you need a single yarn to form a path from one spot in your textile to the next. There are a number of ways to do this, which we highlight below.\nConsider the size Ratios between Conductive and Non-Conductive Yarns. # One of the most common challenges of intergrating condutive traces is that conductive threads are not easy to source in a wide range of sizes, and often are much thinner compared to weaving and knitting yarns. They also have different characteristics due to their metallic nature, for example, they like to arch and wiggle in different ways. For these reasons, mixing them into cloth can require some special techniques.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Simple\u0026rdquo; Approach # If your conductive yarns or threads are very thin and your non-conductive much thicker (as is often the case) consider integrating the conductive as a supplemental material in certain regions of the pattern. In knitting, this means simply carrying the conductive along with the base yarn and knitting the two yarns at once as seen in Irene Posch\u0026rsquo;s Early Winter Night Biking Gloves. In weaving, this means throwing two materials in a pic at once (your conductive and non-conductive) in the regions where the material is required following an inlay techniques:\nTo desribe the inlay techinque more deeply. Consider figure b in the image below:\nWhere \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo; shows the \u0026ldquo;base\u0026rdquo; structure of the textile, \u0026lsquo;b\u0026rsquo; shows how a second or \u0026ldquo;supplemental\u0026rdquo; weft yarn can be integrated into the textile structure while weaving in a continuous fashion by integrating a yarn only in specified section of the cloth. Figure \u0026lsquo;c\u0026rsquo; shows that this is possible with supplemental warps as well, yet, I tend to avoid using supplemental warps for traces because they require more setup and are more difficult to make continuous. You can see many different possibilities of supplmental wefts below.\nWhen logging my process in the form of woven drafts, I like to describe supplemental wefts as a second weft weft system (e.g. the base cloth is one system, supplemental weft as the other) that is interlaced, line by line, into a base draft as shown below:\nHere, I can thread my loom to support the base draft and insert the supplemental yarns in the indicated regions by hand because it follows the same pattern as the base path.\nWhen weaving on a TC2 jacquard, I upload the entire bitmap and wind small shuttles of my conductive traces to integrate in the smaller regions. In the draft above, I would then wind seven individual bobbins (one for each segment) and integrate them as indicated by the draft. In the regions where the segment runs vertically, I just tuck the weft under one end each pic, gradually working it up the length of the cloth. Your supplemental weft and base cloth do not need to follow the same path for instance, you may wish to float more of the supplemental weft on the surface by using a weft-faced twill. In these cases, make sure your artwork is large enough to support at least one interlacement per pic and to perhaps add a small selvedge region around the supplemental weft to make sure the ends of the square regions are cleaned and consistently caught and worked into the cloth as seen in this draft for a woven electrode. The image below details how using a different stitich on the supplemental region can allow the traces to float above the base cloth, yet, will often require the use of a selvedge/catching stitch on either side to ensure clean edges.\nThe Advanced (and not always better) Approach # Pick a base non-conductive yarn that is just as thin as your conductive and integrate it only in the required regions. In knitting, this can be achieved with techinques similar to intasia:\nThis tecnique is used by Irene Posch with the Knitted Capacitor.\nIn weaving, the selective placement of two materials along the weft requires time-expensive weft interchanges where the conductive and non-conductive yarns are manually worked across a portion of the cloth width and looped around eachother on either side. This can be accomplished by threading one stitch across the width of the cloth and manually interlocking the desired conductive yarns in place as shown here:\nIn this example, color-changing conductive yarns have been integrated into the cloth manually such that the base cloth does not run the entire width.\nMany Ways of Making Traces # Weaving and knitting aren\u0026rsquo;t the only way to integrate conductive material into cloth and other opportunities exist at different stages of the design pipeline as described below:\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/docs/materials/cellulose-fibers/","title":"Cellulose","section":"Materials","content":" Cellulose Based # Cellulose fibers are obtained from plants such as cotton, flax (linen), bamboo, and hemp.\nCotton # Cotton is the most commonly used material in garments.

In a different project, we soldered silicone coated wires directly to an arduino pro mini and then integrated the arduino into a pocket within the woven structure, then wound the edges of the wire and yarn together within the fabric itself. You can see the FTDI connector pocking out of the fabric below, with the black wires routing through the structure.\nSoft-to-Soft # Knots # The first method can be simply knotting materials together. In soft-to-soft, this can be as simple as typing a weavers knot, ensuring it will remain tight, and then trimming long ends to ensure against shorting. In soft to hard connections, one typically can knot around the through-hole of a hard component. In this case, it can be wise to coil the material through the hole a few times to ensure good contact between the metal fibers in your soft material and the metal connections on the component you are connecting to. Frequent method of using knots include knotting conductive material around a metal snap and on the other side of the metal snap, soldering on a wire.\nTemporary Connection Methods # There are also alternatives to using something like alligator clips when testing your circuit by using materials, like pins and clips, that have been designed to hold to textile structures.\nIrene Posch\u0026rsquo;s Collection of Handmade Connectors for Soft Electronics:\nhttp://www.ireneposch.net/tooling/\nAdapted Seem Ripper:\nhttps://www.plusea.at/?p=2220\nProcess Example Combing and Carding Spinning Extruding/3D printing Plying Plying the connecting materials together or plying one material around another Braiding Braiding the connecting materials together in sheath or connecting core and sheather Paper-Making Growing Knitting Weaving Embroidery Embroidering directly into the through-holes of hardware.

The amount of resistance can be measured by a multimeter and depends on a number of factors such as temperature, width, material, etc. A resistor, in traditional electronics, is used to limit the voltage provided to a particular part of your circuit (because Voltage = current * resistance).\nMaking Resistors with Conductive Thread # In traditional electronics, you typically purchase resistors of set values that you need. In soft electronics, you can make your own resistors by simply measuring the amount of resistance of a conductive thread of a given length and cutting a length long enough to provide the total amount of resistance you need. More resistance, longer length. For less resistance, cut. The key is that you have to find a way to integrate that length of yarn into your project in the region it is needed and you must ensure that, in order to get the resistance you require, the length of string does not cross itself. If crossing does happen, the electricity will follow the path of least resistance, and provide a much lower value of resistance than you require. (However, this same principle can be really useful when making resistive sensors). Since you can find conductive yarns in a wide range of resistance values, you can use these measures to balance against length. For instance, a higher resistance material will require a shorter length to obtain a certain resistance value than a lower resistance material.\nWeaving Resistors # For weaving resistors, its common to simply throw a conductive/resistive yarn every so many pics so that it is sure not to touch. I find throwing every 2 pics is typically good enough to prevent shorts.\nKnitting Resistors # Knitting resistors can be accomplished by carrying-along a resistive yarn with the knitted structure or replacing certain rows with a resistive material.

Most yarns are often made from several strands of singles.\nSingles are produced when roving or top are twisted in the process of spinning, turning into a longer yarn-like structure. Most yarns are created through one or more singles joined together, in a process called plying which adds additional structure and texture to yarn. singles are always unbalanced, as they consist only of fibers with one direction of spin (called Z or S twist). The amount of twist within singles is said to imbue it with a certain amount of \u0026ldquo;energy\u0026rdquo;. This energy can be harnessed in knitting and weaving to create different elastic or dimensional shapes and structures, or to create a form of weaving known as \u0026ldquo;collapse weaving\u0026rdquo;.\nPrimary Measurements # twists per inch: the amount of twist applied to create the singles (can also be expressed as a twist angle). wraps per inch: a measure of the width of the single calculated by winding around a one inch length at a neutral tension. denier: describes the mass of a singles for a given length. Specifically, the number of grams per 9000 meters. a single strand of silk has a denier of 1, meaning that higher deniers carry more mass than silk and lower deniers are finer than silk.

These might include the introduction of electricity into the textile structure, the integration of non-tradiitonal materials into textile structures to support shape or color change or structures that have unique mechanical properties.\nElectrical Components # When working with electricity in textiles (e-textiles), what is required is metal yarn or thread. A metal yarn conducts electricity meaning it can carry electicity from a battery or power source to a series of loads (things within the cirucuit). The metal yarn acts as the trace or route for the electicity between components in the same way a wire connects components in a traditional circuit. In fact, you can sew or weave with normal wires as well, and I reccomend 30 AWG silicone coated wires as being nicely conductive and flexible with an insulated coating to prevent shorts.\ne-textiles have shown to be able to support the creation of many form of sensing and actuation. A sensor is something that changes its electrical signal in response to a mechanical deformation. In e-textiles, many times this takes place by measuing changes in resistance, for example, when the electical path is able to shorten in response to particular movement. Many of the structures of textiles inherently become sensors when you weave in metal threds and Kobakant shows many possibilities for this. THe main point is that e-texiltes pracitioners are not usually buying pre-made sensors and attaching them to fabric, they are re-inventing the sensors within the structures of texiltes themeslves.\nActuators are eletrical components that convert electricity to movement. These typically require power loads beyond what textile systems can support but are achievable through the clever use of pully systems, shape memory alloys, or electro-magnets, heat-responsive color-changing materials, pneumatic tubing.\nCircuit Basics # If you remember your grade-school science lessons, you might remember learning about electricity with an example like this:\n__Creative Commons __CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LED_in_simple_Direct_Current_Circuit.JPG__\nHere, the power leaves the battery on the + side, travels across the black lines (wires) and then flows through points B, C, D. Along the way, in this example, it encounters, a light and then a resistor become continuing to ground (-). This same principle holds in smart textiles, though we tend to use conductive yarns instead of wires or we use wires, but we weave or knit them into the structure of the textile, hooking up different components along the way.\nA conductive material is one through which electricity can flow, and they most often include some metallic component. Lynne Bruning gives an excellent intro into testing your yarns for conductivity. To test, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a multimeter and SparkFun offers a nice tutorial for how to use a multimeter. For testing conductive threads and yarns, I recommend buying \u0026ldquo;minigrabber\u0026rdquo; leads for your multimeter, which make it easier to hold the yarns during testing.\nSparkFun also offers great lessons on this topic as well:\nWhat is Electricity? Voltage, Current, Resistance, and Ohm\u0026rsquo;s Law What is a Circuit Series vs. Parallel Circuits How to Use A Multimeter Metric Prefixes Resistance # One of the most critical points to understand for learning smart textile, or when beginning, is a deep understanding of resistance and how it varies (by shape, temperature, material and cross-sectional area). This helps us understand how we can use resistance as a way to measure changes to our soft structures and whether or not those changes mean what we think they mean. It will also help in determining your material choice of any conductive materials. I found Khan Academy to be an excellent resource for me to brush up on my understanding of circuitry and resistance in general. Its also worth noting that most circuits we will be describing operate on direct current (or DC).\nResistance is a measure of how easily the electric current as it flows through a length of material. It is measured in Ohms (Ω). Materials that carry lots of electricity have low resistance and are called conductive materials. Materials that don\u0026rsquo;t carry electricity easily (but still move it from A to B) have high resistance and are called resistive materials. The amount of resistance you measure will be proportional to the length you are measuring (short lengths of a given material will have a lower resistance than long lengths of a given material \u0026ndash; assuming the materials you are measuring has the same diameter/area and is at the same temperature).\nCapacitance # Capacitance is a second principle that is important for smart textiles. Capacitance describes the amount of charge that builds up between conductive objects that are not touching\u0026ndash;most often represented as conductive plates. Changes in capacitance tell you how close or far another conductive/grounded object is from your circuit.\nControlling the Flow of Electricity # Electricity flows from power (often from a battery, wall outlet, or microcontroller to ground.\nTraces are another way that electricity gets from one place to another. It is a particular path of for electricity to follow and are made from conductive materials. We catalog several method for textile based traces on the Traces page. Insulation describes materials that do not allow electricity to flow through them. When paired with traces, insulation allows you to block electricity from flowing in particular directions. The flow of electricity can be turned on or off, or routed in different directions through buttons and switches. To flow electricity through various components in a circuit, you will need to explore different methods for connecting things together. This can be as simple as a knot or more complicated if you need to connect you soft textile circuit to a hard material.\nSome Simple Strategies for Weaving Circuits # Sometimes you may not be ready to craft your entire sensor, in which case you can basically just embed a normal circuit into a textile form by weaving (or sewing) a pocket that is large enough to fit the component and then routing the wires to a batter held in another pocket. Connect your components together with crimp beads, metal snaps, or custom connectors.\nSensors # A sensor describes an arrangement of materials that changes its electrical properties in response to some external stimulus (light, pressure, proximity, electromagnetic fields). These changes in the electrical properties can be measured by multimeter, micro-controller, and/or computer, and thus, can be used to trigger certain computational processes. Sensors are sometimes classified by the property that is tracked for changes. In this book we have sections devoted to resistive sensors, capacitive sensors, and sensors that detect electromagnetic fields (microphones) and/or radio waves (antennas).\nActuators # Actuators describe arrangements of materials where some change in their state is triggered by electrical stimulus. These include motors (electromagnets), speakers, and state-changing materials\nHarvesters # This is a category that I hear people use, and assume its meaningful, but it describes arrangements of materials where physical stimuli induce electrical power into the circuit. These include solar cells, piezoelectric materials and structures that can generate energy from electromagnetic waves.\nMicrocontrollers # A microcontroller is a tiny computer designed specially to make sense of the electrical changes coming from your circuit. An Arduino, is a very common microcontroller for hobby projects and a great general purpose board with tons of tutorials. I have found Teensy great for audio projects and Raspberry Pi is great for projects that need more processing power.\nNon-Electrical Components # Response textiles may not require electricity and some might argue amterials like wool, which regulate body temperature or offer anti-microbial benefits are already responsive.\nWhen it concerns shape changing \u0026ldquo;3D\u0026rdquo; Textiles, many have explored the use of overtwisted yarns as a means of addign elasticity and self-shaping into the textile structure. Similar one-way deformations are possible with the integration of heat-shrinking and dissolving yarns as well.

If you look closely, you can see the two individual singles strands twisted together. Image Credit: Natalia Wilson on Flickr.\nThe yarn or thread that you purchase for projects just as knitting, sewing or weaving is plied meaning that it has been created through a process of plying several singles yarns and/or filaments together.\nA 2-ply yarn is made of 2 singles, a 3-ply is made of three singles and so on. In some cases, yarns that have already been plied together can then be plied together another time to create \u0026ldquo;cabled\u0026rdquo; yarn structures.\n​\nSo, to make a yarn with 4 plys, one has the option to either ply four singles together at once or make 2, 2-ply yarns and later ply them again into a single 4-ply yarn. The first is called 4-ply, the second 2x2ply. The cabled yarns will be more durable than the 4-ply yarns.\nThis photo is of a conductive silver yarn reveals a cabled structure where filaments are loosely twisted and then again twisted again into a more complex structure.\nYou can find another description of plied structures here and a description of cabling here.\nThis structure contains two linen singles that are plied with a stainless silver strand\nPrimary Measurements # Note, yarns tend to be described differently by their suppliers and the application that they intend for the yarn to be used within. However, any yarn can be used for any application.\nwraps per inch: A measure of yarn width calculated as the number of wraps of the yarn that can fit within an inch at a neutral tension. You can find a demonstration here. gauge (knitting): A measurement of yarn weight oriented towards knitting: https://www.craftyarncouncil.com/standards/yarn-weight-system ratios (weaving): weaving yarns are sold with measurements describing the weight of the yarn and number of plys within the structure. This includes measures like 20/2 Cotton or 10/2 tencel. The numerator describes the weight of the yarn, with higher numbers indicating finer weight. The denominator describes the number of plys: https://spinoffmagazine.com/yarn-numbers-mean-weaving-yarns/ ratios (Conductive Yarns/Filaments): Some sellers of conductive yarns also follow this convention, only their numbers are a bit more wild like 117/17 Silver 2-ply or something wild. Kobakant helped me understand this by noting that the numerator indicates the Denier, the denominator is the number of filaments, and the 2-ply describes the number of plies. According to Shieldex, the denier applies to only one of the plies, meaning that the actual weight would need to be multiplied by 2. I can\u0026rsquo;t say I totally understand this but for the product above, I would guess it means that 17 filaments make up each \u0026ldquo;ply\u0026rdquo; within the two ply structure (meaning the total number of filaments in the thread overall is 34. This is the weight prior to being coated with silver. I still find this so confusing and it seems to shift by retailer. cross-sectional width (Conductive Yarns/Filaments): To add another hitch to our measuring questions, sometimes resellers will describe their yarns/wires in terms of the diameter in microns or expressed as AWG, which is a measure that corresponds to the diameter of a cross-section of the wire but is wacky in that it scales logarithmically. The rule of thumb for me, using copper, is that the higher the number the thinner the wire. 40 AWG copper is about as thin as my hair and breaks easily. Something between 36-28 AWG has been the ideal for textile work as it is relatively strong yet also very thin and workable into the textile structure. linear resistance (conductive materials): conductive materials can also be described by their linear resistance which is the amount of resistance (in Ohms) per unit length. This measure depends on the material and construction and will also vary with the amount of force applied to the yarn. As Anita Vogl very well explains in her talk comparing different structures for conductive stretch sensors (@ 2:00minutes). She gives and explanation of how staple fibers will lower resistance when stretched because the air between fibers will be condensed, putting the fibers into closer contact and creating more pathways for electricity to flow. _**_Filament based yarns become narrower when pulled, creating smaller cross-sectional width and, therefore, will raise resistance on stretching.

Balanced yarns like to hold their structure by having equal amounts of twist in both directions.

Some soft sensor and actuator structures rely on traces being insulated from one and other, others don\u0026rsquo;t. In some cases, you might also find that your materials already come insulated. In others, you need to provide insulation yourself. You can test if your material is insulated or not by connecting a multimeter across a length of conductive string and seeing and checking for a connection. In some other cases, you may want to insulate your entire circuit or just one trace from another. Below we list a few common methods for insulating:\nCoatings # the most frequent way that materials are insulated when you purchase them from suppliers is with a a coating. For instance, magnet wire often comes with a thin enamel coating. In order to connect directly to the metal wire, you have to burn (with a lighter) or use sandpaper to scratch the enamel. In other wires, the coating is more easily spotted as a thicker and/or colored flexible silicone. These coatings can affect the performance of your circuit. For instance, in tests of heating wire, we found that even a thin layer of enamel coating limited the heat transfer between the conductive element and materials.\nCovering/Layering # Some wires you source will come entirely wrapped in fiber to provide coding, such as cotton covered wires. These are essentially core spun yarns with conductive cores and non-conductive/insulating sheaths. In other cases, you may cover your entire circuit in an insulating materials (like felt) so you can bend it without the fear of crossing traces.\nSpacing # A second technique is to space your uninsulated traces such that they will not touch. This works well when your circuit will lay flat or will not fold upon itself unintentionally. Tests can help you determine how much spacing you need between traces to ensure they do not contact. In weaving, we have found that 2-3 picks is typically enough to insulate one wire for another. Some weaving stitches can allow you to cross an uninsulated warp and weft thread without touching by floating one thread to the front of the fabric and the other thread across the back. Again, tests are needed to determine exactly how long you need your floats.\nBeads # beads can be useful form of adding insulation around regions of an uninsulated conductive yarn, particularly for applications where you need movement and flexibility. The bead acts as a sheath protecting that section from yarn from becoming touched by another.\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/docs/dynamics/electromagnet/","title":"Electromagnets","section":"Dynamics","content":" Electromagnets # Electromagnets describe magnetic feilds that are created by the flow of electricity through wires.

Many motors are also controlled by electromangets that push and pull a central shaft around a central point.\nThe most basic form of electromagnet is a coil made from magnet wire. To make one by hand, just grab some 28AWG magnet wire, write it around something like a pencil a few hundred times, and connect either end of the magnet wire to a 9 volt battery. Switching the polarity of the circuit (e.g. which ends of the coil are connected to the + and - side of the battery) changes the direction of a magnet field. You can test this by dangling a strong magnet (like a neodynium magnet) just over the coil on a string. You should feel the magnet attact or repel as you change the polarity of the coil.\nInspiration # Irene Posch - The Embroidered Computer Here, coils are integrated via embroidery.

These interconnecting loops can create a flat-(ish) textile with the ability to stretch in all directions as well as tubular or flat circular structures that strength along their length and width. The amount of stretch for a given knit depends on the materials, density, and stitches used. A stitch describes a specific combination of yarn manipulations in the fabrication process that imbue the knit with a particular structure (we cover this more in our process section).\n__\nKnitting is often used for the creation of soft and stretchy textile items such as sweaters, blankets, plush toys as well as athletic garments or other garments that require a skin-tight fit.\nChoices of material, stitch and density can vary across the surface of a knitted structure, allowing different regions of a single textile to display different mechanical properties. This allows for some materials to be integrated into portions or regions of the knit, etc. Additionally, one can knit with a single material or two materials in tandem, for instance, if they want to pull from a material like wool and a thin material like copper at once while their knitting, joining them in the structure without the need to ply.\nKnitting allows for the construction of shapes without textile waste. One works with different patterns, structures, increasing and decreasing stitches to create shape. The structure of knits varies by the stitches used in their production, which make the knit more or less stretchy, more or less open in various regions of the overall structure.\nAn image showing the stretchiness of a knit swatch\nThe knotted nature of knits means that the materials used in knitting tend to be very flexible with a high bending radius.

Grown, felted, and electrospun materials are often not structurally stretchy, as they are relatively uniform and solid structures.\nPrimary Measurements: # The method of describing or measuring a non-woven would vary by the material.\nInspiration: # Printing, Cutting, Attaching: Iris Van Herpin\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tKk11nA_SY\n3D printed fabric structures: Francis Bitonti\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aac9RAU9EIk\n3D printed fabrics: Nervous Systems Kinematics Dress\nhttps://vimeo.com/113561369\nMalu Luecking Bio Plastic Non-Wovens\nhttps://maluluecking.pb.design/bioplastic\nGiulia Tomasello, Conductive Bio Skins\nhttps://issuu.com/giuliatomasello4/docs/bio_conductive_skin\nSlime Molds?\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/all-hail-the-blob-smart-slime-mold-confounding-science/\nDIY Smart Paper\nhttps://www.futurity.org/smart-paper-detects-water-1597562/\nMushroom Burial Suits\nhttps://coeio.com/\nVegan \u0026ldquo;Grape\u0026rdquo; Leathers\nhttps://www.vegeacompany.com/\n"},{"id":22,"href":"/docs/structure/woven/","title":"Woven","section":"Structure","content":" Woven # A woven textile structure is created by interlacing material (most often plied yarn and filaments) in two directions: the warp (threads running along the length), and weft (threads running along the width). These structures are created by stretching or \u0026ldquo;warping\u0026rdquo; a set of parallel yarns (or radical yarns in circular weaving), and then interweaving the weft yarns in a perpendicular direction to bind the textile together. The specific patterning of \u0026ldquo;overs\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;unders\u0026rdquo; gives the woven textile different thicknesses, ability to sheer, and durability, etc.\nfigures representing different structural possibilities for woven fabrics\nBecause of their durability and less stretchy structure, woven fabrics are commonly used in upholstery, denim, and tailored garments like suits. They are also used in industrial applications to create composite materials or abrasion resistant pads or architectural materials (e.g. wire meshes, etc).\nWoven structures are not inherently as stretchy as knits and the structure of weaving equipment makes working with stretchy materials challenging. Yet, like knitting, woven structure can be varied across the surface of a fabric giving rise to materials that have different mechanical properties in various regions.\nOne of the strengths of weaving is its ability to easily create multi-layered structures, where multiple layers and interlacements of layers can be woven at one time. This allows for pockets and tubes to be easily embedded into the structure of a woven fabric, a technique that is often used for the creation of quilted fabrics but can also be used for multi-layered woven circuits.\nBecause woven tend not to be stretchy and require less knotting or looping of materials (in most cases), weaving is often preferable for brittle materials or materials that do not bend well. Furthermore, the process of weaving makes it easy to integrate a wide variety of materials with a wide variety of widths into the structure, creating interesting textures and methods for integrating \u0026ldquo;hard\u0026rdquo; materials into their soft structure.\nWovens are described by the materials, equipment (e.g.yarn density represent) and stitches used expressed in the form of weaving patterns.\nWoven Structure Inspirations:\nSheila Hicks https://www.sheilahicks.com/ Lenore Tawney https://lenoretawney.org/ Annie Albers https://albersfoundation.org/ Gunta Stolzl https://www.guntastolzl.org/Works Beryl Korot https://art21.org/artist/beryl-korot/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIs7bzqa-E6wIVjYbACh0_NAPCEAAYASAAEgKVMfD_BwE Textiel Lab Sample Studio: https://samplestudio.textiellab.nl/samples/ Primary Measurements: # woven fabrics are best expressed as patterns or \u0026ldquo;drafts\u0026rdquo;.

The metallic fibers numbers are consistently measured where the other numbers should be taken with a VERY BIG grain of salt as I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to find consistent measurements across fibers so they represent whatever I could find anywhere.\nThe table below shows that silver is the least resistive (most conductive), copper than stainless (with some in between, but I just included these fibers since they are the most commonly sourced.\nCopper # Copper is typically a good material that can be found in lots of form factors, in solid form or plated/wound, insulated and uninsulated and is generally cost effective. Most copper filament is sold as \u0026ldquo;magnet wire\u0026rdquo; and available in many diameters. I find 38 AWG magnet wire most workable in terms of strength and flexibility. Copper yarn is also a bit more cost effective than silver for roughly similar conductivity. People advertise copper as a material with wonder-benefits for anti-aging and promoting health, but it is more commonly used as a shielding and grounding material with antibacterial, anti-viral, and anti-fungal properties.\nThese images show a detail of the Karl Grimm Kupfer Blanc 7x1 solderable copper yarn (7 strands, 1 ply).

Because its highly conductive, it will feel cool to the touch. Much of the silver conductive yarns sold are other materials like polymers that have been silver plated, instead of solid silver. This method will determine exactly how conductive your silver yarn will be.\nBelow we show several ways that silver is integrated into yarn below:\nIn this \u0026ldquo;Silver Spun\u0026rdquo; product, silver (5%) is plied with combed cotton (87%), Nylon (5%) and Spandex (3%). It is very soft and stretchy.\nThe microscope image and my guess from the percentages seems to suggest that a silver plated nylon is plied with cotton/spandex singles.\nKarl Grimm also makes a solderable silver yarn in the same 7x1 configuration as the copper show above. It also looks as though a sheet of silver is wrapped around a core within each of the 7 singles that make up the yarn.\nSilver also is the material used in this more resistive yarn provided by V Technical Textiles shown below.\nThis image shows that many individual strands of silver plated nylon are plied together. Because there are so many small fibers and because of the ply, you might expect this yarn\u0026rsquo;s resistance to lower when stretched, as the individual sheets of silver would be more closely touching.\nStructure Possibility to Source in this Structure Fiber Difficult, could make by cutting filament, perhaps \u0026ldquo;Smart Silver\u0026rdquo; Roving Difficult Plied Yarn Easy (e.g. Karl Grimm, Resistex, Silverspun, Swicosilver, Circuitex) Braided Rope Easy (e.g. Sold as Grounding Braid (Silver Plated Copper)) Filament Difficult (e.g. I could only find it sold by Kazhtex) Knit Easy (e.g. Sold as Shielding Fabrics) Woven Easy (via Statex) Non-Woven Easy (e.g. Swift Textile, Silver Leaf) Stainless Steel # Stainless steel is an alloy made from iron and chromium.

The templates are easy to produce in cardboard on a laser cutter at various thicknesses. During this braiding, the maker has more control over tensions than they might with techniques that spin yarns together, thus, they may be ideal for applications that require brittle materials to be integrated into the outer structure of the yarn. It is also nice because it can adapt to several different numbers of individual yarns composing the braid. If you want to braid around a core, you simple pace your core material through the hole in the center and while you are braiding, it will wrap around that core on its own.

The entire assembly is rolled in order to help the fibers mesh with the base fabric.\nI tried (a lazier and home-spun version of) Nuno this in order to get a sense of how the process would feel. I selected a fabric mesh that I had woven from cotton and silk (which is thicker than other materials typically used) and experimented with the felting of several different fibers: cotton fiber, mulberry silk fiber, shoddy, wool, merinox stainless/wool fiber). I placed my fibers on top of the fabric and in a sushi roller before adding cold (with a watering can) and soap (just dawn dish soap). I placed a sheet of tulle on top fo the fibers when I worked them to help keep them in place. I worked them by pressing and applying weight (I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a fancy waffle iron looking thing like they have in some videos) so I just used a delicata (its kind of like a round waffle iron) to rub and roll across the textile :) I then rolled the entire thing in a towel 100 times. When I felt the fabric could handle it, I dipped it in hot water and threw that wet sucker on the table a few times, which helped the felt fibers bind to themselves a bit. Part of my testing was to experiment with the wool/stainless steel fibers to see if I could felt a pressure sensor and it worked!\nHere is the result, with the multimeter showing the resistance changes on no press, light press, and hard press, ranging from disconnected (no press), 698 ohms on light press, and 150 ohms on hard press. Overall, this is a really nice large change it was also a really economical use of the fiber, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to use that much of my precious steel/wool fiber (and much less than I have to when I spin it and weave it into the structure). The black material is the wool, and it bound nicely to the backing. The white fiber is the cotton, whose staple fibers were quite short, so it sort of just clumped on itself. The really shiny silver was silk and it was so lovely, but never really bound with the fibers all that well. The shoddy was a lost cause, just clumped up and did not bind to the fabric so much so that i just peeled it off.\nResources # Joan Cornell Simple Scarf\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0ZybwUs2jQ\nJoan Cornell Sari-Silk Jacket\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK8sKVYCUr8\nNuno Felted waistcoat with Svetlana Vronskaja (attention to volume and sculpting)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfCNBo2R45c\nNuno Felting Flat Sheets\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3nZ4jEJpHk\u0026amp;t=306s\n"},{"id":36,"href":"/docs/process/growing/","title":"Growing","section":"Processes","content":" Growing # a process of doping a material or guiding a material as it grows over time.

Most skeins of yarn will recommend a knitting needle size, but there are ways to play around with knits to create textiles that have multiple properties. For instance, you can use multiple needles when knitting, and change the tension of the knit as you are working. One could use a chunky yarn with a small needle to create a dense knitted textile. Or a lace weight yarn with large needles to create a very loose, soft textile. One fabric can change from densely knitted to and large open knit just by changing needle size.\nFor instance, I knitting a small 10 stitch x 10 stitch stockinette swatch using three different US needle sizes, 19, 8 and 4 and the image below shows the results. The (poorly knit) swatch on the left had the largest needles (at 19) and resulted in the loosest structure. The center swatch was knit with the recommended needle size (8) and the swatch on the right was size 4. All swatches were stretchy with the most open structure stretching the most radically.\nCasting On # The first step in knitting casting on, which means creating the first row structure that you will build your stitches upon. Different methods for casting on will add different properties to your knit piece. For beginners, it might be best to start by focusing on the Long-Tail cast on demonstrated in this video by Wool and the Gang.\nKnitting # As you knit, you will be able to vary the combinations of your stitches (ordering of knits and purls) used to create different textures, values, and material integration within your swatch.\nSurface Texture # Surface texture describes small scale changes in volume and structure that give the fabric surface a certain visual (bumpy, smooth) and mechanical (directional stretch) texture\nAs you knit, you will be able to vary the combinations of your stitches (ordering of knits and purls) used to create different textures within your swatch. We highly recommend the beginner\u0026rsquo;s series by Wool and the Gang. Beginners will want to focus on mastering the basic knit and purl stitches, then may experiment with stockinette, and then can go wild attempting different stitches and combinations.

These larger volumes are made through combinations of increasing and decreasing stitches, which essentially allow you to add or remove value in certain regions. Other more complex structures and pockets can be created through methods of double knitting.\nIntegrating Multiple Materials\nWhile there are specific techniques, like intarsia knitting, focused on the use of different colors and regions of a knit, there are also more ad hoc techniques like switching your yarns every few rows or \u0026ldquo;carrying along\u0026rdquo; a second yarn with your base yarn within certain regions as we show below. These can be particularly useful to adding a small conductive wire through your structure within a given region.\n****\nBind Off # The last step in knitting is the bind or cast off, which secures the structure from unraveling.\nHand Knit Project Inspiration # Knit Steganography (hiding messages in knitted structures): https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/knitting-spies-wwi-wwii SkyKnit: A machine learning project for training based on knitting patterns https://experiments.withgoogle.com/skyknit#:~:text=SkyKnit%20is%20a%20fun%20project,creative%20ways%20into%20physical%20creations.

The gauge of the machine refers to the spacing between the needles in the bed of the machine, which allows for different size yarns to run through the machine. These machines can be programmed electronically, or via punchcard. Punchcard machines are possible to find at second hand shops or in giveaway piles but need tender love and care to work properly. The second type of knitting machine is a \u0026lsquo;V-bed\u0026rsquo; machine. V-bed knitting machines allow for more complex stitch structures and for double knits, and seamless knitting. These are more difficult to happen upon but are most common in industrial knitting. The two beds, arranged in a V, are able to pass yarns back and forth across the layers. Another common kind of machine for knitting is a circular knitting machine, where needles are arranged along the edge of a circle to create a continuous tubular knit for objects like hats and socks. Circular knitting machines are readily available in varying levels of quality.\nDIY Machines \u0026amp; Inspirations: # Kniterate: DIY V-Bed Machine https://www.kniterate.com/ Merel Karhof Wind Powered Circular Knitting Machine: https://www.merelkarhof.nl/work/wind-knitting-factory Damien Ludi \u0026amp; Colin Peillex Rocking Chair Powered Knitting Machine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6m92HRZm2Y Industrial Knitting:\nIndustrial knitting machines produce the garments that we purchase in stores today.

You can make cores and core-spun yarns using plying, but you cannot make hollow structures. You can ply with 2, 3, or however the hell many yarns you like, but its probably best to stay on the small side (under 6) to keep structure if you are doing this somewhat freehand.\nPlying is most often used to make a yarn \u0026ldquo;balanced.\u0026rdquo; Meaning that the yarn contains twists in two directions that hold it a steady structure. Thus, plying yarns must occur in the opposite direction that they were spun. The twist of yarns is described as \u0026ldquo;Z-twist\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;S-twist\u0026rdquo; and it is a measure relative to your own body.\nIf you want to ply yarns together, here is what you do. Each of the singles strands is already contains a twist (lets say Z-twist) in one direction. Align all your singles so they are oriented in the same direction (all Z-twist) and then join them together by twisting them together in the opposite direction (the S-direction). If plying already plied yarns, add twist in one direction to each strand independently and then, starting from their shared end, twist them in the opposite direction to allow them to form onto each-other.\nStructure Ability to be Plied Raw Fiber no, needs to be in the form of singles first Filament yes Roving \u0026amp; Top yes?, for a more open and loose structure Singles yes Plied Yarn yes Braided Rope yes (I don\u0026rsquo;t see why not?)

In a well formed yarn, the two strands will always coil nicely around each-other, here shown as regularly alternating color. If you did a 3-ply, you would see the three colors repeated regularly, meaning that the yarns do not intersect each-other perpendicularly within a ply. In some cases, this feature can be exploited for insulation.\nIf you are spinning two ply, and you find that as you relax the yarn, it curls up on itself, that is called \u0026ldquo;ply-back\u0026rdquo; and it creates a plied structure of your already plied yarn - turning a 2-ply into a 2x2 ply or cabled structure from a continuous yarn.\nIf we look closely at our 2-ply, you can see that the twist goes in the direction of an \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; twist. When we ply those 2-plys on each other again (shown in right), we twist them in the \u0026ldquo;Z\u0026rdquo; direction to form a balanced yarn that is stronger and holds its structure.\nThis produces a 2x2 cabled yarn, as you see in the right. Here you can see that the structure looks like a braid (as we have plied in materials again in the other direction). This puts all the materials in contact with each other.\nThis image is to note that the 2x2 structure you get from ply-back is the same as if you plied two singles into two 2-ply yarns, and then plied them together.\nAnd if we want to take it one step further, we can ply-back on our 2x2 ply and add another 2 to the equation for a 2x2x2 yarn with 8 ends.\nHistorical Connections # Sections of the transatlantic cable photographed at the Henry Ford Museum\nI was lucky enough to be able to see one of the original pieces of the transatlantic cable at Henry Ford Museum.

Sometimes we need to look back in order to find ideas for the future and I like to see this as an example of the ways that \u0026ldquo;smart textile\u0026rdquo; structures and concepts have been embedded within our society long before the present moment.\n"},{"id":43,"href":"/docs/process/plying/ad-hoc-plying/","title":"Ad Hoc Plying","section":"Plying","content":" Ad Hoc Plying # You can also ply by hand by twisting any long and durable material in your hands, in one direction, folding it, and gently encourage its natural inclination to spin in the other direction.\nOnline Resources # A DIY Conductive Thread / Rope Machine - Lynne Bruning Demonstration of Plying 6 Strands into Rope on a Large Scale.

It is also possible to spin raw fibers around other structures, such as wires or filaments in a process of core spinning.\nTo spin, a spinner drafts, or feeds, a collection of fibers into their spinning devices (wheel or spindle). The spinner users their hands (or otherwise) to control the propagation of the spin up the length of the unspun fiber. As the spin propagates along the length of the fiber, it is wound onto a spool. The final step in spinning is called finishing, by which the yarn can be washed, steamed, lassoed, whacked/twacked, menaced, and a whole host of other hilarious words, to help the yarn achieve is final state.

The spindle was tossed in such a way that is spun through the air as the spinner fed it with fibers. For those interested in how these techniques varied in medieval times by region, you may enjoy this demonstration of technique.\nAs cloth became a major commodity in China, India, and Islamic regions, the demand for yarn rose and people started to search for faster ways to spin yarn.

Some argued the origins of the spinning wheel trace to China as well.

You begin by preparing your warp yarns, or the series of tensioned that you will interlace. These are most often stretched parallel to each other but can also be arranged in other radial or triaxial patterns (more common in basket weaving). After these are stretched and of uniform tension, you weave a long thread in and out, or over and under, the warp yarns. The combination of overs and unders and the sequencing will determine the visual and structural nature of your fabric. After adding a row over and under the weft, you can beat or comb it down to form the fabric.\nThe structure that supports weaving is called a loom and techniques vary by the class and type of loom. As Annie Albers writes in her wonderful book \u0026ldquo;On Weaving\u0026rdquo;, any woven structure can be realized on any type of loom. The different looms, thus, just make particular actions more or less efficient or allow for different lengths of yarn. I\u0026rsquo;ve listed looms and techniques below by complexity. This is not an exhaustive list, but ones that are more common.\nStructure Ability to be Woven Raw Fiber yes, if integrated into short regions of the weft, difficult Filament yes (for warp and weft) Roving \u0026amp; Top yes, if integrated into the weft Singles yes (only in weft) Plied Yarn yes (warp and weft) Braided Rope yes (warp and weft) Knits yes for tubular knits, narrow flat knits, or knits rolled and/or layed flat as weft Woven yes for narrow, flat, or tubular weaves or rolled wovens into the weft Non-Wovens yes, if sliced or rolled into thin long pieces or rolled and placed in the weft Solid Objects yes, especially if they are long and narrow, if they can be threaded through the weft, or otherwise integrated at weave time into the pockets of a multi-layered structure. Process # Selecting Yarn and Looms # When beginning to weave, the materials and equipment are usually considered in tandem. Yarns for warping need to be durable and strong because they are placed under tension during the weaving process. Weft yarns can be just about anything, yet, for most beginning weavers, its good to start with warps and wefts that are of comparable size and materials.\nThe weaving density depends on the number of warp yarns per inch across the width of the loom. This is measured in \u0026ldquo;ends per inch\u0026rdquo; or epi. Weaving yarns are often soft with a suggestion of ends per inch which ought to match to your equipment. Some looms, like tapestry, rigid heddle looms, or jacquard looms, have fixed positions for you to stretch the warp into or heddles fixed at predetermined position and thus, you must find yarns to match your set up. Alternatively, you can always use less than the maximum density, so long as it still maintains the correct ratios and settings of your equipment. Other looms, like frame looms allow you to vary the density (though you typically need to find a \u0026ldquo;reed\u0026rdquo; for beating that matches your desired density). Most of the woven clothing you wear will be of a density that far exceeds what is possible on consumer grade equipment (e.g. 100 epi). Most craft weaving will consist of something around (6-20 epi)\nWarping # Warping is the process of threading your loom and ensuring warp yarns are of even tension. The procedures for warping depend on the specific type of loom.\nWeaving: Primary Stitches and Patterns # The diagram below shows the general process of weaving, particularly on a heddle based loom. An understanding of this process aids in explaining the differences in stitches and patterns.\nAll woven structures are created from the selection of \u0026ldquo;unders\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;overs\u0026rdquo; on any given pic. These patterns are represented by drafts that represent the minimal repeating unit that characterizes the fabric structure. If the weft travels UNDER the warp (same as: a heddle lifting that warp ), the draft square is colored solid or black. If the weft travels OVER the warp (same as: the heddle not being lifted at that warp), the draft square is colored in white or transparent. Namely, if you repeat these drafts across the weft (width) and warp (length) of your fabric, you would create a fabric made entirely of that stitch. Stitches can also be alternated or shifted arbitrarily across the length or width, depending on the loom you are using.\nThe ordering of these selections has infinite possibilities, but the three most basic structures are:\nTabby or Plain Weave: This is the weave you likely learned in school and made with paper. This is shown in the diagram above. This is where the weft alternates over and under each warp. Each row alternates the order (so if you stared with an over than under, the next row is under and then over). Tabby weaves create the most spacing between all the warps and thus the widest and thinest possible structure with any given weft yarn. Tabby weave structures are not stretchy in either direction. Weaving yarns will typically give you a suggested \u0026ldquo;set\u0026rdquo; which is how many warps of that yarn would fit in an inch of the resulting fabric.\nTwill: Twills are commonly seen in denim. This pattern (shown in the diagram above), consists of some repeat of overs and unders that uniformly shift position along the length, often creating visual diagonal. Twills can be balanced (meaning that they contain the same number of overs and unders each pic) or unbalanced (where the number is uneven). Unbalanced twills are called weft or warp facing depending on whether the weft travels over more or less warps respectively. The balanced or unbalanced ratio twills will allow them to pack less or more (respectively). When wefts are tightly packed, the fabric becomes thicker and more durable (which is why it is used on denim). Furthermore, twills create more textured surface structures and can vary in their amount of sheer. Unbalanced twills will also sometimes produce fabrics that curl when removed from tension. When working with different colors in the warp and the weft, the balanced or unbalanced ratio of the twill will produce different levels of shading in the resulting fabric because they modulate the ratio of warp and weft yarns that are visible on the surface. This shading will be inverted or flipped on the bottom side of the fabric.\nSatin: Satin stitches are similar to twills in that they can be unbalanced at each pic, but stain weaves do not uniformly shift to create diagonal lines. Instead, the structures shifts at each row such that the interlacements (places where a series of unders go under or vice versa) are never directly next to each other. This creates long \u0026ldquo;floats\u0026rdquo; of weft yarns that pack along the surface to create softer fabrics. Satins also exhibit the same shading effects as twill, given their ratios of unbalance and can be weft-faced or warp-faced. The use of satins is typically how regions of contrasting colors are integrated into the structure of fabrics.\nMany More: There are so many others, particularly waffle, basket, and birds eye stitches that have really nice properties particularly when integrating sensing.\nFinishing # Finishing is the process of removing the woven fabric from the loom and fastening the ends so it does not easily unravel. The easiest finishing method (in my opinion) is quickly running the ends of the fabric through a sewing machine. Typically, long ends of the warp are exposed on the front and back ends of the fabric, and can be left as fringe, twisted into tassels, or cut off entirely.\nDocumenting \u0026amp; Patterning # Woven patterns are described by drafts, which are made using a grid structure with each cell of the grid representing the location of a warp and weft crossing each other. As such, these often describe the structure, but not the materials. A black cell denotes that the weft travels UNDER the warp at this location and a white cell denotes that the weft travels OVER the warp at this location. So if you were going to draft an entire fabric, the number of cells in the width of the draft would total number of warps in the fabric. The number of cells in the height would represent the number of pics. The convention in weaving is to represent your fabric in the smallest amount of units. Thus, if your entire fabric is made of repeating a series of pics over the width and length of the fabric, then you would represent only the repeating unit with a note at how many times it should be repeated (or let the weaver decide for themselves).\nConventions in drafting have to do with the hardware that one is using for weaving. Often, jacquard looms require each instruction to be specified (so the draft will represent the entire weave pattern). Most looms use frames to support quick weaving of repeating patterns, and thus, these drafts often represent those patterns instead of the fabric overall. The draft represents corresponds to actions on a loom and how it relates to a given structure.\nHistorical Connections # Weaver (1974), A Portrait of Margaret Carr\nhttps://www.folkstreams.net/film-detail.php?id=407\n1800-1900 American Hand-weaving Industry and Child Labor\nTradition Bearers (1983)\nhttps://www.folkstreams.net/film-detail.php?id=281\nFinish-American Craft History, focusing on Great Lakes Region\nNavajo Weaving # The story of Spider Woman\nBeauty Before Me: Navajo Weavers\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_Tj4lr8i_k\nA Loom with a View: Modern Navajo Weavers\n2004 - Produced by Sierra Ornelas and Justin Thomas\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkAggO4D8Og\n"},{"id":55,"href":"/docs/process/weaving/on-a-frame-loom/","title":"On a Frame Loom","section":"Weaving","content":" Frame Loom Weaving # As you might expect, hand threading a yarn over and under every row can be tedious, which has given rise to the development of horizontal looms with heddles, or, contraptions that lift the warps for you. The heddles lift the yarn, and the weaver throws the yarn through the opening, or shed, lowers the heddles and beats the row they just laid to meet the fabric. The particular selection of heddles on any given row are called the pic. If you are looking to learn, Peggy Osterkamp is the go to source for learning. Many heddle based looms consist of the use of frames (which contain sets of heddles) and treadles which easily allow different frames to be lifted in combination with one another.\nWeaving on a Rigid Heddle Looms # Rigid heddle looms often have one frame, making it easy to quickly weaving tabby and inviting the weaver to play with other hand techniques integrated with the tabby.\nFrame/Shaft Looms\nFrame or Shaft looms are made to fit on table tops or floors and can have 2 to as many as 24 frames, depending on the loom. Frame looms also come in a variety of widths. When warping, the weaver threads each frame with a particular sequence of warps (most simply, a \u0026ldquo;straight draw\u0026rdquo; which takes every 1st warp and puts it on frame one, every 2nd on frame two, every 3rd on frame three (and so on). To create a pattern, then, one \u0026ldquo;lifts\u0026rdquo; the frames that give them their desired pic. The lifting is done by hand or by the use of treadles, foot pedals that attach to different sets of frames allowing you to select them. Frame looms make it easier and faster to produce repeating patterns. Some frame looms are computer controlled, allowing motors to lift the frame rather than pedals. These are often called dobby looms. The loom shown in the image above is a 8-shaft Floor Loom. Further specifications (e.g. jack loom, countermarch) describe the mechanisms that raise and lower the heddles (and often make it physically easier to do so, especially with large numbers of shafts and or wide widths).\nFrame Loom Draft:\nThis is a draft that I created for my frame loom that shows the primary units that repeat across the width of the fabric. To help with my process, I use non-white to represent any area where the Weft travels UNDER warp, but different shades to different colors of material. The resulting material looked like this (horizontal is the length/warp). What is interesting to note is that every section of the weave was created by components of this draft, but that changing materials in both the warp and weft really create the visual pattern. It is also good to reming yourself that when you weave, it will not be square like your draft, thus, you often have to make adjust your draft to what \u0026ldquo;square\u0026rdquo; means in your draft. For instance, in the weave below a square was composed of about 20 warps and 30 wefts.\nYet, above I cropped the most important part out of the picture, which is the part of the draft that represents how to thread the frames, tie up the frames to the treadles, and shows the treadling pattern. If you need a refresher on how the loom works, you can reread the process section for weaving on heddle-based looms. So now here is the full picture:\nThe top left shows the tie up, the top row shows the threading, and the left shows the treadleing. The grid in the bottom right, shown before, is called the draw down.\nInterpreting a Draft\nFirst of all, if you have time, you are free to ignore all the other business and follow the pattern in the lowest and rightmost grid and simply do all the over/undering by hand. So the first row would be over 1, under 1, over 1, under 1 and on and on. The next would be over 1, under 1, and so on.\nIf you have a loom with heddles, it will save you immense amounts of time. As such, when you would go to make this pattern on your loom, you would begin with the threading, threading each warp through the frame indicated by the grid. So on this draft, you would thread the left-most warp to the 6th frame, the next to the 5th, the next to the 6th, then the 3rd, 4th, 1st, 2nd, and so on and so forth. Typically, the \u0026ldquo;first\u0026rdquo; frame is the one closest to the fabric beam or the front of the loom and they are numbered successively from front to back. Another explanation can be found here: https://weavingspace.co.uk/blog/threading-draft/\nWhen you are done threading, you would then work on the tie up (if you\u0026rsquo;re loom has pedals, otherwise you might have to select these frames by hand on each row by raising and lowering levers that raise and lower frames in different combinations. The tie up, thus, represents which frames need to be lifted in any given pic to achieve your desire pattern. So from left to right, I would start by tying frames 1, 2 and 6 to the first treadle. Then I would tie 3,4, and 6 to the next treadle. Then 2, 4, 6 to the next, and 1,3,5 to the last. You can find additional details here: https://weavingspace.co.uk/blog/reading-a-tie-up/\nWhen you sit down at the loom to weave you refer to the left most grid to understand the treadling. This is the order in which you push the pedals (or lift the levers) in order to get the pattern represented in the lowest and right most grid. Put another way, it represents the specific pics that have to be repeated to obtain the structure. Here is another explanation: https://weavingspace.co.uk/blog/treadling/\n# Writing a Draft # Sometimes you know the structure you want, but not the machine settings to obtain that pattern. Or you have a textile you want to mimic, but you don\u0026rsquo;t have the draft at all. You can do this by first looking very very closely at the fabric and manually marking the draw-down where you note over and unders. Some people photocopy their fabric and enlarge it to make this simpler, or take apart the fabric row by row to understand the order of threads and over/unders.\nI think the Weaving Space blog offers a nice tutorial on a way of doing this that is more germane to weavers but I tend to approach it like a computer scientist. Once you have the draw down you follow an algorithm, told in pseudo-code below:\nFor each column c in the draw down Look at all the cells in c and represent the sequence from top to bottom as a bitstring (e.g. 0 meaning white, 1 meaning black; sequence reading as (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;, 1)) if this if the first column OR the bitstring is DIFFERENT from one you have seen previously: assign it (fill in the cell) in the next unused frame in the column c on the above threading pattern. if you have seen this pattern before assign it (fill in the cell) of the column c in the above threading pattern in the same frame row that corresponds to the column of which the pattern is a repeat. For each row r in the draw down Look at all the cells in r from left to right and represent the sequence of cells as a bitstring (e.g. 0 meaning white, 1 meaning black; sequence reading as (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;, 1)) if this if the first row OR the bitstring is DIFFERENT from one you have seen previously: assign it (fill in the cell) in the next unused treadle column in the row r on the treadling pattern to the left. if you have seen this pattern before assign it (fill in the cell) of the row r in the treadling pattern on the left in the same column that corresponds to the row of which the pattern is a repeat. For each row r in the treading pattern; scan until you find the column that is assigned to this row, call that c look at the draw-down for row r, for each cell in r of the draw-down; if the cell is white, do nothing if the cell is black, locate the assigned threading frame row f that corresponds to that draw down cell, and color the cell at row f and column c in the tie down black. How to Weave on Floor Loom # Anatomy # Below is the anatomy of a floor loom.\nThe loom consists of several parts. More details about each part can be found in the key terms section.\nBasic Mechanics # [1] There are multiple treadles on the loom. There are multiple shafts on the loom.\n[2] The treadles can be tied up to as many shafts as the weaver desires. The tie up connects the shaft to the treadles so that the weaver can control which warp is raised and lowered\n[3] Pressing on the treadles tied to the shafts raises the warp creating the shed\n[4] The treadles can be tied up to as many shafts as the weaver desires.\nFloor Loom Process Overview # Warping # Synopsis of Warping Process:\nMeasure the warp Tie the Cross Attach warp to the back apron rod Insert Lease Sticks Thread the heddles Sley the reed Tie the warp to the front apron rod Tie up treadles Step 1: Measure the Warp\n[1] Gather two bobbins of thread that are contrasting colors. Then, find a warping board and hang it such that you can access the pegs easily.\n[2] Start with your first colored thread. Create a slip knot in one end of your thread and place it around the first peg. This will be the start of our guide thread.\n[3] Then, wrap the thread along the warping board by following the image above and secure it on the final peg with another slip knot. This thread will guide where you wrap your warp threads.\nChandler 56\n[4] Next, we are going to follow the guide string to add to the warp. This includes making a cross around the final two pegs. The cross is a figure-eight path around the final two pegs which will be helpful for string management later on. The left image shows the cross in context of the entire warping board.\n[5] The right diagram shows how thread is taken around the final pegs to create the cross. When you reach the final two pegs, you will take the warp thread over the second to last peg, under and around the last peg (#1), and back under the second to last peg (#2) to meet the thread you brought again on top of the third to last peg (#3). )\n[6] The video and illustration show adding a warp thread to the board with a cross\n[7] When you reach the initial peg again (as shown by step 4 above), you will repeat this motion until you have measured 12 threads of this first color.\n[8] To get 12 threads, you will travel from the first to last peg and back, counting a new thread each time you reach an ending peg. EXAMPLE: starting on the first peg, you travel along the board until you reach the end of the cross. That is 1 thread. Then, after making the cross you travel back to the first peg. That is the 2 threads. You can check your progress by counting the number of threads on top of the second to last peg and multiplying it by two (half of the threads will be over the cross and half under).\n[9] Once this first section is complete, you will tie a counting thread on the warp which is used to lay threads in the correct order on the loom later on.\n[10] Tie the counting thread on this bunch of thread so that it will secure that bunch together but you can also take it out later on. A half knot will suffice. See on the right image how that same counting thread will be secured to the next bunch as well, so make sure to cut enough to span the width of your warp.\n[11] Next, you will need to grab the second color you picked so that you can use if for your next stripe. [12] Begin by cutting the end of the first color about an inch or two past the end of the peg and tie the second color to it.\n[13] With this second color attached, measure 12 threads again just as before. [14] When finished, tie the tails of the counting thread from the first stripe around that inch of warp you just made with the second color\n[15] Then, cut the end of that second stripe, and re-attach the first color to the end just as before. Measure 12 threads with that color.\n[16] Continue this process until you have 10 total stripes, 5 of one color and five of the other color\nStep 2: Tie the Cross\n[1] Now that you have all your warp, you want to secure it before moving it over to the loom to ensure that the threads stay in order\n[2] To do so, we will tie a string around 5 areas: the top and bottom of the loops on either side of the cross and around the intersection of threads themselves. Begin by tying string around the loops as seen above. Again, you will eventually untie these, so make sure they are secure enough to hold the threads, but loose enough to get undone\n[3] Next, you will tie the middle of the cross. Begin by taking a string around the back of the cross so both ends are facing you\n[4] Then, wrap one end of the string back through the loop and around to the front on the other side.\n[5] Tie the two ends together to make a half knot\n[6] Now, double check that your counting threads are all tied properly and tie one more piece of thread around the middle of the warp\n[7] Finally, tie the top and bottom of the starting loop just as you did the loops of the cross.\nStep 3: Attach Warp to Back Apron Rod\n[1] Begin by lifting the beater out of the loom by taking off the rail and reed so that you can easily access the shafts.\n[2] Slide all heddles on the shafts to the sides so there is a clear space between them\n[3] Place the warp along the loom by wrapping the cross end around the front beam and guiding the rest of the warp to rest on the back beam\n[4] Pull the apron rod up to the end of the warp on the back beam, slide the warp over it, then tighten the apron rod slightly with the crank on the left of the loom. We will spread the warp out next, so make sure to leave a little slack\n[5] Spread the warp out on the apron rod into even bunches. We have 120 total threads and want to spread the strings out in 4 equal sections. So, we spread 30 strings into each section (designated by the white ties holding the apron rod to the warp beam). Therefore, in each section there are 2.5 of each color block.\n[6] Remove the counting tie, then continue spreading the warp into these equal sections along the apron rod.\n[7] Make sure to be meticulous in this process, we want to make sure all strands are laying in the right order and flat on the apron rod\n[8] With the apron rod set, move to the front of the loom and tug on the warp at the cross end to create tension across the warp.\n[9] Work from front to back to ensure that all the threads are in order and laying flat\n[10] Once you feel like the threads are nicely lain, you can crank the back beam to tighten the warp across the loom\nStep 4: Inserting Lease Sticks\n[1] Gather some thread and tie two loops around the top rail of the last shaft, closest to the back beam. Spread them out to about the length of the lease sticks. This is where your lease sticks will be held. See on the left side how this thread will hold the lease sticks when they have been set.\n[2] Gather the lease sticks and place one on either side of the cross. Tie the ends of the lease sticks together so that they cannot fall apart off of the warp.\nEugene Textile Center\n[3] Slowly shimmy the lease sticks back, pulling the cross closer to the back beam. When you pass through the final shaft, loop the ends of the sticks in the hanging thread to secure. At this point, you can cut the ties around the cross as it is secure now.\nStep 5: Threading the Heddles\n[1] To thread the heddles, begin by winding the warp in so that there is only 8-10 inches reaching out past the first shaft.\n[2] Slide 30 heddles from each shaft (total of 120 heddles) over to the right side of your warp. These will be the heddles you thread.\n[3] We are going to thread a straight draw. Starting on the very far right most warp thread, we are going to take the first thread through the 4th shaft, the second thread through the 3rd shaft, the third thread through the 2nd shaft, and the fourth thread through the 1st shaft. Then, we repeat this process for the rest of the warp so that the threads are threaded in the pattern 4,3,2,1 all the way through.\n[4] Begin by pulling the first four heddles out to the right of the warp. They should be in the order 4,3,2,1 as shown above\n[5] Now grab the first color of warp and cut the loop at the end so all the threads are even\n[6] Thread the newly cut warp through the heddles as described in step 3 above. To reiterate, the furthest right thread will go through the 4th shaft heddle, the second to last warp through the 3rd, and so on through the 1st shaft heddle. After each color block is threaded, tie all the warp threads together in a slip knot to keep them threaded and out of the way.\nNote: heddles have directions, so make sure that the warp thread travels straight through from the back beam to the front. You can figure out which way is correct by threading multiple ways.\nStep 6: Sleying the Reed\n[1] Next we will sley the reed, meaning that we will bring the heddle threads through the reed. Begin by replacing the reed on the beater (remember we had removed this back when laying the warp down).\n[2] On the right hand side of the beater arm, there is a pin used to secure the beater in place. Make sure to secure this pin before starting to sley.\n[3] Once the beater is set, release the warp so that there is 8-10 inches of warp that can come out past the beater. Now we are ready to sley.\n[4] Grab one section of color, untie the slip knot, and separate out the last four threads on the right hand side of the warp.\n[5] Spread the four threads out in your hand and bring forward over the beater\n[6] Now, measure the length of the reed. The floor loom reed is 26” long and we have 10” of warp. So, we will have 16” of warp leftover when finished sleying. That means we want to start the warp 8” from the right hand side of the reed so that our warp is centered on the reed.\n[7] With the first slot in mind, pull those first four threads out and use the sley hook to grab the furthest right thread and pull it through the dent you identified to be 8” into the reed\n[8] Repeat this process with the rest of the threads in your hand, placing each new thread in the next dent over from the first. It is easy to skip a dent or place two threads in one dent, so double check you are placing only one thread in each along the way.\n[9] Continue sleying the rest of the color block that you are on. When finished with a block of color, tie another slip knot to keep all the colors together.\n[10] Repeat this process until all the warp is sleyed. On the left, you can see what the threads look like as they are placed through the dents and tied with a slip knot. On the right you can see how to grab the thread with the sley hook from your hand and pull it through.\nNote: it is helpful to have a small loop in the thread being slayed for the sley hook to grab on to\nStep 7: Tie the Warp to the Front Apron Rod\n[1] At this point, the reed is completely sleyed.\n[2] Release the front beam from the lock and lay it back against the loom\n[3] Next, pull the front apron rod up and over the front beam.\n[4] Begin tying the warp onto the apron rod. To do so, split the section of warp into two pieces and wrap around the apron rod by first taking the warp thread over the rod towards yourself and then back under the rod toward the loom. Then, tie the two ends together loosely. This will allow you to easily adjust the tension\n[5] Repeat this process for all warp sections until all of them have been tied on the apron rod.\n[6] Adjust and re-adjust the knots until there is even tension across all of the sections of warp. Once even tension is achieved, double knot each section to secure.\nStep 9: Tie Up Treadles\n[7] The last step to set up the loom before getting to weaving is tying up the treadles. You can vary your woven piece quite a bit by changing the treadle tie up. Make sure to look at your draft to determine the treadle tie up for your desired piece. If you are unfamiliar with a draft, see the next section to learn more about each component.\nThreading # Variation in threading patterns provides opportunity for different weaving patterns. Threading variations are unlimited, but families of weave structures or patterns are produced from particular threading. (Chandler 113)\nIn this tutorial, we threaded a straight draw. This means that the threads are placed in the following order: shaft 1, shaft 2, shaft 3, shaft 4, repeat.\nThere are many other ways to thread, see resources here: Learning to Weave\nFull Draft # What is a draft? # Drafts are the weaver’s blueprints. The blueprint tells the weaver which combinations of frames/shafts to raise together (tie-up), which order to raise the shafts (treadling), which yarn to throw at each pick (treadling), and what the fabric will look like overall (drawdown).\nChandler 120\nNishizaki\nParts of a draft # Threading - as described above in the warping section, threading tells you what shafts and in which order to thread the warp through the heddles.\nBooker [1] Every row in the draft represents one shaft and every column represents one warp end. The number indicates which shaft each warp end should be threaded on. The numbers in the boxes refer to the shaft number. These can be replaced by symbols or colors.\n[2] “Xs” are also a common way to mark threading. The threading diagram on the right lines up to the shaft and warp ends to display what this threading looks like on the loom.\nTie-Up - the tie-up tells you how to connect shafts and treadles. On a floor loom, the shafts are connected to the treadles via a string.\n[1] Treadles are tied to shafts via strings. Each vertical column represents a treadle and each horizontal column represents a shaft. Here, you can see that treadle 1 lifts shafts 1 and 3.\nTreadling - the treadling is the order in which you press the treadles and which yarns to throw at each press of the treadles. TODO\nDrawdown - the drawdown is a visual representation of what your fabric will look like. TODO\nDraft Examples # See below several examples of drafts and their woven result.\nDouble Weave\nTop\nBottom\nBoth Layers\nPlaid Weave Tabby Weave Twill Weave Weave # To begin weaving, gather all necessary shuttles and fill the bobbins with yarn. See process for spinning bobbins below.\nNote You will need to reference your draft for the number of yarns you will need.\nSpinning Bobbins\n[1] take bobbin out of shuttle by pulling up on the open end and sliding plastic bobbin off of shuttle’s metal rod\n[2] Gather yarn and place about an inch of the end into the hole of the bobbin. This will help keep the yarn attached to the bobbin when we start spinning it.\n[3] Place the end of the bobbin with the string into the left end of the spinner. Pull back on the pointed end of the spinner to make room for the rest of the bobbin, then place the other end of the bobbin into the pointed end of the spinner.\n[4] Spin the yarn on the bobbin by pressing the pedal and moving the yarn back and forth so that it spreads evenly across the bobbin. CAUTION: The pedal is very sensitive! A little pressure goes a long way\n[5] Once the yarn has been properly spun, take it off of the bobbin and place it back into the shuttle for weaving. Make sure to cut the small end of thread that was tucked into the end of the bobbin in step 3 to ensure the thread does not get caught in the when throwing the shuttle.\nWeaving Process # [1] Following your draft, raise a selection of warp threads by pressing down on the treadle\n[2] When heddles are lifted, they raise the warp threads that are threaded through them, creating a shed. This is where the shuttle is thrown through.\n[3] The shuttle, carrying the weft thread, is thrown through the shed. This adds a weft row, or pick, to the cloth.\n[4] A weaver closes the shed (lowers all the warps) and beats, pressing the new weft on top of the previous weft. This pressing packs the weft yarns in the weave\n[5] Repeat this process until your piece is at the size you desire. See below demonstration for throwing the first pick\n[6] Demo for the first pick. For the first pick, leave a little bit of extra thread on the end for finishing purposes later on.\nEach pick after this (throwing the yarn and beating it) will look identical, the only difference is that your thread will line up with the edge of your piece at later rows as it wraps from one row to the next.\n[7] Demo for a pick in the middle. To create a clean edge, try and pull your yarn close to the outermost warp thread after you throw the shuttle.\nFinishing Your Piece\n[1] Your piece is finished! You just threw your last pick and now you are ready to remove it from the loom. First, cut a long lead that removes your shuttles from your piece (about the same length as what you left on the first pick)\n[2] Now, release the tension on the loom by pressing the break release foot pedal (rightmost treadle). This treadle is connected to the warp roller and slowly unwinds the warp, allowing more yarn to come forward for use.\n[3] Now that the warp is loose, cut small portions at a time to release your piece from the loom. Leave a few inches of warp on your piece to ensure the last pick does not unravel\n[4] At each cut, make a slip knot to keep the warp from falling out of the beater.\n[5] Once your piece is cut loose, you should have all of your warp knots tied. Your piece will just be connected to the front apron rod.\n[6] Next, you can slide your piece off of the front apron rod. You will have frayed edges that you can then finish. Run the piece through a sewing machine with a straight stitch to ensure the piece does not unravel.\nKey Terms # beat/pack: action for closing the shed and pressing the new weft on top of the previous weft beater: packs the inserted weft yarns down.

A weaver can freely weave in and out of the yarns creating more freeform structures and pushing down yarns with a comb. Tapestry looms (and the resulting tapestries) can range in size. This video shows an example of tapestry weaving on a large loom. Tapestry weaving tends to be the most free-hand weaving processes, and tapestry weavers often freely integrate different materials, colors, etc in non-rectangular shapes. These tapestries often exist as artful wall hangings and rugs. Sheila Hick\u0026rsquo;s collection of tapestries in the book Weaving as Metaphor show a large extend of the possibilities of working in this way. Tapestry looms can also be made from ad-hoc materials such as sticks or even eyelashes. The Met offers a nice tutorial on how historical tapestries were made.\nDrafting For a Tapestry Loom: # Typically, tapestry weaving involves more complex and hand-involved stitches, and so the drafts often show more than overs and unders, but also show places where you put colors, wrap yarns around eachother, etc. The conventions for this are hard for me to find. When weaving repeating patterns on a tapestry, people often follow the same conventions as a frame draft.

If we use electrical components to provide the heat needed for color change to occur, then we can essentially \u0026ldquo;program\u0026rdquo; the color changes by turning the heating elements on and off.\nSteps # There are many ways to combine fiber, pigments, heat, and electronics but we\u0026rsquo;ll focus on:\ncreating a thermochomic paint or prepping a thermochromic dye applying the paint/dye mixture to fibers creating a tight coupling of heating wire to fiber creating circuitry to programmatically power the heating wire. Materials # heat activated thermochromic dye\nor heat activated thermochromic pigment\nwhile you can buy dyes and pigments that transition between colors, I prefer to use pigments/dyes that trandition from color to colorless at about 86 celcius. I find bold colors (dark blues, greens, violets) have a more interesting visual effect than lighter colors (reds, pinks, yellows). The dyes produce a better hand quality on the fiber but tend to only produce muted tones, if you want darker and more concentrated color you are better off mixing your pigments with a transparant acryllic gel medium. This essentially suspends the pigments in a paint and the the higher the pigment/paint ratio is on mixing, the bolder the color. fiber based material\nif using the dye, your fiber should be a cellulose-based material like cotton. If using the painting method, any fiber structure (paper, yarn, fabric, etc) can be used. For this specific lesson, we\u0026rsquo;ll use wool yarns. I like working with wool because it holds heat nicely, allowing the effects of the color change to last a bit longer. heating wire\nmagnet wire makes for a great heating element. The thinner the wire, the more heat produced (see Joule heating for more on the physics of this). I think 38 AWG (AWG = American Wire Gauge, a measure of the diameter of the wire) is about the thinnest yarn that\u0026rsquo;s workable without breaking. Fun fact, the higher the AWG, the thinner the wire. crimp beads\narduino microcontroller and jumper wires\n(optional) external power supply\nN-Type MOSFET\nTools # painting or dying tools drop spindle crimp beads sand paper wire cutters and clamps (optional) sewing needle and thread, knitting needles, looms, etc. Procedure # 1. Paint or Dye your Fiber # Prepare a thermochromic dye bath (according to the dye instructions) or mix acryllic medium with thermochromic pigments until you achieve your desired color (just add as much pigment as you like, more pigment = darker color). To achieve your desired consistency, mix in some water. Apply the dye or paint to your fiber using one of the following methods:\na. Hand Painting the Yarns. # Arrange the yarn along a table and manually paint along the length making sure to paint the front and back side. If you want to paint lots of yarn, consider attaching your yarn to a bobbin winder on a sewing machine or hand crank, holding a paint filled sponge with one hand to coat as you crank. If you can also paint directly upon a pre-made fabric.\nb. Dying the Fibers # Prepare the dye bath and submerge your yarns following the package instructions. In this example, I started with raw cotton sliver\nI submerged the fiber into the dye bath keeping it over constant heat.\nAfter drying the sliver, I can breath upon to active the color change. c. \u0026ldquo;Dying\u0026rdquo; Wool with Vinegar # A thrid technique we have used is to mix vinegar and the thermochromic pigments before submerging wool fiber. This is not a color-fast method, but it does create a nice temporary result.\nd. Silkscreen # Many use silkscreen to apply thermochromic paints to fabrics in precise patterns. This technique is featured in Jingwen Zhu\u0026rsquo;s Heart on Your Dress Project.\n2. Integrate Heating Wire # Once you have prepared your fiber, you can integrate your heating wire using any of the techniques that follow. The key consideration is to create as tight a coupling between the wire and dyed fabric as possible. Any air between the wire and fiber will significantly reduce the heat transfer.\na. Sewing in the Magnet/Heating Wire # Hand sewing is a quick and easy for you to integrate your heating wire into your cloth. In the example below by Emilia Pucci, the heating wire is integrated by threading it into the surface every so often and otherwise, floating it along the back of the fabric. The heat, then, would appear in little spots as it radiated out from the wire on the surface of the cloth. You can read more on Emilia\u0026rsquo;s post about the project. The key when sewing is to keep the ends of the magnet wire long so you can connect to them later. Also, don\u0026rsquo;t cut the magent wire or anypoint, as that would break the eventual electric connection and result in the inability for the magnet wire to transfer heat.\nb. Plying Magnet wire with Yarn # With plying, you create a tight coupling between the wire and yarn by twisting them together as showin in the diagram below (assume the \u0026ldquo;pink\u0026rdquo; yarn is your magent wire and the \u0026ldquo;black\u0026rdquo; yarn is the dyed yarn)\n)\nAnne-Marie Lavigne also has a nice video of this process as part of her Woven Signals project.\nThe benefit of plying is you can make really long lengths of heated yarn with a tight coupling of yarn to heating element. Also, the method of applying will put the connections on the same side of the reuslting yarn, allowing for easy connection.\nb. Weave, Knit, Crochet # Alterantively, you can weave your heating wire directly into the fabric itself. The images below depict various ways that one or more heating wires were integrated to allow for different interactive effects. You can read more in this paper.\nYou can also integrate the heating wire and dyed yarn using a carry-along method in knitting or crochet. Here, you simply carry the magent wire along as you knit to integrate it. This creates some issues and complications with yarn tension and also may not create a tight coupling between yarn and wire, but it is possible.\n3. Connect Heating Wires to Jumper Wires # Your heating wires have a thin insulated enamel coating that keeps their metal from shorting and conducting. To connect to the wire you need to either burn off the enamel coating with a lighter OR use sandpaper to scratch off the coating. You can use a multimeter to check that you can, in fact, make a direct connection with the wire.\nOnce you have exposed the metal in the heating wire, attach them to wires, aligator clips, or another type of connection using crimp beads. Namely, thread one end of your heating wire AND one end of the jumper wire through the crimp bead and then crimp the bead down to firmly attach the wires.\n4. Connect to A Power Source # To activate the color change, we need to power our heating wire and make it heat up. Resistive heating is a power hungry operation and requires quite a bit of current and voltage. The longer your heating wire, the more current and voltage you will need. Since your Arudino only offers 5V in a digital output pin, and at most 500 mA of current, sometimes it is neccessary to power your project with an external power supply and \u0026ldquo;switch\u0026rdquo; that power on and off using a transistor. We\u0026rsquo;ll show you each way below:\na. Direct Connection to Arduino # In this schematic, I\u0026rsquo;m using the motor to stand in for our heating wire. I do this because motors and heating wires consume similar amounts of power\u0026hellip;.but really they didn\u0026rsquo;t have a thermochromic wire I could choose from in TinkerCAD. Here, we just connect one end of our wire to a digital out pin (in this case, pin 8), and the other end to ground.\nb. Supplementing with an External Power Source # In this schematic, we\u0026rsquo;ll draw from an external power source like a bench power supply or perhaps a 9V battery or directly to wall power. Again, the motor is standing in for the heating wire. Here we use pin 8 as a switch. When a voltage is applied to pin 8, it opens a path between the \u0026ldquo;drain\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;source\u0026rdquo; of the MOSFET. So, we can connect our heating wire directly to the power source and then create a switch on the way to ground that is controlled by the MOSFET.\nDouble check your MOSFET to find the correct positions of the Gate, Source and Drain.\nIn this configuration, you can tinker with the voltage and current to determine an ideal running sceanrio (typically, supplying more voltage will reduce the amount of current consumed.)\nNote, that you can \u0026ldquo;burn out\u0026rdquo; your heating wire if you supply it too much voltage, so be sure to start with a low voltage and work up to your desired heat. In my experience, the magnet wire will burn before it gets to a temperature that could burn you badly. This is not the case with other heating metals, like nicrhome, so I find its best to use materials like magent wire that heat, but don\u0026rsquo;t get too hot.\nVariations # There are endless variations and space to play in these projects\nMixing thermochromics with different activation termperatures can allow for 3 color state transitions. Weave or knit the color changing yarn in with a non-thermochromic yarns of the same base color to create images that appear and disappear. Integrate multilple heating wires in different patterns to programmatically modify the patterns.

More details about each part can be found in the key terms section.\nBasic Mechanics # [1] There are multiple treadles on the loom. There are multiple shafts on the loom.\n[2] The treadles can be tied up to as many shafts as the weaver desires. The tie up connects the shaft to the treadles so that the weaver can control which warp is raised and lowered\n[3] Pressing on the treadles tied to the shafts raises the warp creating the shed\n[4] The treadles can be tied up to as many shafts as the weaver desires.\nFloor Loom Process Overview # Warping # Synopsis of Warping Process:\nMeasure the warp Tie the Cross Attach warp to the back apron rod Insert Lease Sticks Thread the heddles Sley the reed Tie the warp to the front apron rod Tie up treadles Step 1: Measure the Warp\n[1] Gather two bobbins of thread that are contrasting colors. Then, find a warping board and hang it such that you can access the pegs easily.\n[2] Start with your first colored thread. Create a slip knot in one end of your thread and place it around the first peg. This will be the start of our guide thread.\n[3] Then, wrap the thread along the warping board by following the image above and secure it on the final peg with another slip knot. This thread will guide where you wrap your warp threads.\nChandler 56\n[4] Next, we are going to follow the guide string to add to the warp. This includes making a cross around the final two pegs. The cross is a figure-eight path around the final two pegs which will be helpful for string management later on. The left image shows the cross in context of the entire warping board.\n[5] The right diagram shows how thread is taken around the final pegs to create the cross. When you reach the final two pegs, you will take the warp thread over the second to last peg, under and around the last peg (#1), and back under the second to last peg (#2) to meet the thread you brought again on top of the third to last peg (#3). )\n[6] The video and illustration show adding a warp thread to the board with a cross\n[7] When you reach the initial peg again (as shown by step 4 above), you will repeat this motion until you have measured 12 threads of this first color.\n[8] To get 12 threads, you will travel from the first to last peg and back, counting a new thread each time you reach an ending peg. EXAMPLE: starting on the first peg, you travel along the board until you reach the end of the cross. That is 1 thread. Then, after making the cross you travel back to the first peg. That is the 2 threads. You can check your progress by counting the number of threads on top of the second to last peg and multiplying it by two (half of the threads will be over the cross and half under).\n[9] Once this first section is complete, you will tie a counting thread on the warp which is used to lay threads in the correct order on the loom later on.\n[10] Tie the counting thread on this bunch of thread so that it will secure that bunch together but you can also take it out later on. A half knot will suffice. See on the right image how that same counting thread will be secured to the next bunch as well, so make sure to cut enough to span the width of your warp.\n[11] Next, you will need to grab the second color you picked so that you can use if for your next stripe. [12] Begin by cutting the end of the first color about an inch or two past the end of the peg and tie the second color to it.\n[13] With this second color attached, measure 12 threads again just as before. [14] When finished, tie the tails of the counting thread from the first stripe around that inch of warp you just made with the second color\n[15] Then, cut the end of that second stripe, and re-attach the first color to the end just as before. Measure 12 threads with that color.\n[16] Continue this process until you have 10 total stripes, 5 of one color and five of the other color\nStep 2: Tie the Cross\n[1] Now that you have all your warp, you want to secure it before moving it over to the loom to ensure that the threads stay in order\n[2] To do so, we will tie a string around 5 areas: the top and bottom of the loops on either side of the cross and around the intersection of threads themselves. Begin by tying string around the loops as seen above. Again, you will eventually untie these, so make sure they are secure enough to hold the threads, but loose enough to get undone\n[3] Next, you will tie the middle of the cross. Begin by taking a string around the back of the cross so both ends are facing you\n[4] Then, wrap one end of the string back through the loop and around to the front on the other side.\n[5] Tie the two ends together to make a half knot\n[6] Now, double check that your counting threads are all tied properly and tie one more piece of thread around the middle of the warp\n[7] Finally, tie the top and bottom of the starting loop just as you did the loops of the cross.\nStep 3: Attach Warp to Back Apron Rod\n[1] Begin by lifting the beater out of the loom by taking off the rail and reed so that you can easily access the shafts.\n[2] Slide all heddles on the shafts to the sides so there is a clear space between them\n[3] Place the warp along the loom by wrapping the cross end around the front beam and guiding the rest of the warp to rest on the back beam\n[4] Pull the apron rod up to the end of the warp on the back beam, slide the warp over it, then tighten the apron rod slightly with the crank on the left of the loom. We will spread the warp out next, so make sure to leave a little slack\n[5] Spread the warp out on the apron rod into even bunches. We have 120 total threads and want to spread the strings out in 4 equal sections. So, we spread 30 strings into each section (designated by the white ties holding the apron rod to the warp beam). Therefore, in each section there are 2.5 of each color block.\n[6] Remove the counting tie, then continue spreading the warp into these equal sections along the apron rod.\n[7] Make sure to be meticulous in this process, we want to make sure all strands are laying in the right order and flat on the apron rod\n[8] With the apron rod set, move to the front of the loom and tug on the warp at the cross end to create tension across the warp.\n[9] Work from front to back to ensure that all the threads are in order and laying flat\n[10] Once you feel like the threads are nicely lain, you can crank the back beam to tighten the warp across the loom\nStep 4: Inserting Lease Sticks\n[1] Gather some thread and tie two loops around the top rail of the last shaft, closest to the back beam. Spread them out to about the length of the lease sticks. This is where your lease sticks will be held. See on the left side how this thread will hold the lease sticks when they have been set.\n[2] Gather the lease sticks and place one on either side of the cross. Tie the ends of the lease sticks together so that they cannot fall apart off of the warp.\nEugene Textile Center\n[3] Slowly shimmy the lease sticks back, pulling the cross closer to the back beam. When you pass through the final shaft, loop the ends of the sticks in the hanging thread to secure. At this point, you can cut the ties around the cross as it is secure now.\nStep 5: Threading the Heddles\n[1] To thread the heddles, begin by winding the warp in so that there is only 8-10 inches reaching out past the first shaft.\n[2] Slide 30 heddles from each shaft (total of 120 heddles) over to the right side of your warp. These will be the heddles you thread.\n[3] We are going to thread a straight draw. Starting on the very far right most warp thread, we are going to take the first thread through the 4th shaft, the second thread through the 3rd shaft, the third thread through the 2nd shaft, and the fourth thread through the 1st shaft. Then, we repeat this process for the rest of the warp so that the threads are threaded in the pattern 4,3,2,1 all the way through.\n[4] Begin by pulling the first four heddles out to the right of the warp. They should be in the order 4,3,2,1 as shown above\n[5] Now grab the first color of warp and cut the loop at the end so all the threads are even\n[6] Thread the newly cut warp through the heddles as described in step 3 above. To reiterate, the furthest right thread will go through the 4th shaft heddle, the second to last warp through the 3rd, and so on through the 1st shaft heddle. After each color block is threaded, tie all the warp threads together in a slip knot to keep them threaded and out of the way.\nNote: heddles have directions, so make sure that the warp thread travels straight through from the back beam to the front. You can figure out which way is correct by threading multiple ways.\nStep 6: Sleying the Reed\n[1] Next we will sley the reed, meaning that we will bring the heddle threads through the reed. Begin by replacing the reed on the beater (remember we had removed this back when laying the warp down).\n[2] On the right hand side of the beater arm, there is a pin used to secure the beater in place. Make sure to secure this pin before starting to sley.\n[3] Once the beater is set, release the warp so that there is 8-10 inches of warp that can come out past the beater. Now we are ready to sley.\n[4] Grab one section of color, untie the slip knot, and separate out the last four threads on the right hand side of the warp.\n[5] Spread the four threads out in your hand and bring forward over the beater\n[6] Now, measure the length of the reed. The floor loom reed is 26” long and we have 10” of warp. So, we will have 16” of warp leftover when finished sleying. That means we want to start the warp 8” from the right hand side of the reed so that our warp is centered on the reed.\n[7] With the first slot in mind, pull those first four threads out and use the sley hook to grab the furthest right thread and pull it through the dent you identified to be 8” into the reed\n[8] Repeat this process with the rest of the threads in your hand, placing each new thread in the next dent over from the first. It is easy to skip a dent or place two threads in one dent, so double check you are placing only one thread in each along the way.\n[9] Continue sleying the rest of the color block that you are on. When finished with a block of color, tie another slip knot to keep all the colors together.\n[10] Repeat this process until all the warp is sleyed. On the left, you can see what the threads look like as they are placed through the dents and tied with a slip knot. On the right you can see how to grab the thread with the sley hook from your hand and pull it through.\nNote: it is helpful to have a small loop in the thread being slayed for the sley hook to grab on to\nStep 7: Tie the Warp to the Front Apron Rod\n[1] At this point, the reed is completely sleyed.\n[2] Release the front beam from the lock and lay it back against the loom\n[3] Next, pull the front apron rod up and over the front beam.\n[4] Begin tying the warp onto the apron rod. To do so, split the section of warp into two pieces and wrap around the apron rod by first taking the warp thread over the rod towards yourself and then back under the rod toward the loom. Then, tie the two ends together loosely. This will allow you to easily adjust the tension\n[5] Repeat this process for all warp sections until all of them have been tied on the apron rod.\n[6] Adjust and re-adjust the knots until there is even tension across all of the sections of warp. Once even tension is achieved, double knot each section to secure.\nStep 9: Tie Up Treadles\n[7] The last step to set up the loom before getting to weaving is tying up the treadles. You can vary your woven piece quite a bit by changing the treadle tie up. Make sure to look at your draft to determine the treadle tie up for your desired piece. If you are unfamiliar with a draft, see the next section to learn more about each component.\nThreading # Variation in threading patterns provides opportunity for different weaving patterns. Threading variations are unlimited, but families of weave structures or patterns are produced from particular threading. (Chandler 113)\nIn this tutorial, we threaded a straight draw. This means that the threads are placed in the following order: shaft 1, shaft 2, shaft 3, shaft 4, repeat.\nThere are many other ways to thread, see resources here: Learning to Weave\nFull Draft # What is a draft? # Drafts are the weaver’s blueprints. The blueprint tells the weaver which combinations of frames/shafts to raise together (tie-up), which order to raise the shafts (treadling), which yarn to throw at each pick (treadling), and what the fabric will look like overall (drawdown).\nChandler 120\nNishizaki\nParts of a draft # Threading - as described above in the warping section, threading tells you what shafts and in which order to thread the warp through the heddles.\nBooker [1] Every row in the draft represents one shaft and every column represents one warp end. The number indicates which shaft each warp end should be threaded on. The numbers in the boxes refer to the shaft number. These can be replaced by symbols or colors.\n[2] “Xs” are also a common way to mark threading. The threading diagram on the right lines up to the shaft and warp ends to display what this threading looks like on the loom.\nTie-Up - the tie-up tells you how to connect shafts and treadles. On a floor loom, the shafts are connected to the treadles via a string.\n[1] Treadles are tied to shafts via strings. Each vertical column represents a treadle and each horizontal column represents a shaft. Here, you can see that treadle 1 lifts shafts 1 and 3.\nTreadling - the treadling is the order in which you press the treadles and which yarns to throw at each press of the treadles. TODO\nDrawdown - the drawdown is a visual representation of what your fabric will look like. TODO\nDraft Examples # See below several examples of drafts and their woven result.\nDouble Weave\nTop\nBottom\nBoth Layers\nPlaid Weave Tabby Weave Twill Weave Weave # To begin weaving, gather all necessary shuttles and fill the bobbins with yarn. See process for spinning bobbins below.\nNote You will need to reference your draft for the number of yarns you will need.\nSpinning Bobbins\n[1] take bobbin out of shuttle by pulling up on the open end and sliding plastic bobbin off of shuttle’s metal rod\n[2] Gather yarn and place about an inch of the end into the hole of the bobbin. This will help keep the yarn attached to the bobbin when we start spinning it.\n[3] Place the end of the bobbin with the string into the left end of the spinner. Pull back on the pointed end of the spinner to make room for the rest of the bobbin, then place the other end of the bobbin into the pointed end of the spinner.\n[4] Spin the yarn on the bobbin by pressing the pedal and moving the yarn back and forth so that it spreads evenly across the bobbin. CAUTION: The pedal is very sensitive! A little pressure goes a long way\n[5] Once the yarn has been properly spun, take it off of the bobbin and place it back into the shuttle for weaving. Make sure to cut the small end of thread that was tucked into the end of the bobbin in step 3 to ensure the thread does not get caught in the when throwing the shuttle.\nWeaving Process # [1] Following your draft, raise a selection of warp threads by pressing down on the treadle\n[2] When heddles are lifted, they raise the warp threads that are threaded through them, creating a shed. This is where the shuttle is thrown through.\n[3] The shuttle, carrying the weft thread, is thrown through the shed. This adds a weft row, or pick, to the cloth.\n[4] A weaver closes the shed (lowers all the warps) and beats, pressing the new weft on top of the previous weft. This pressing packs the weft yarns in the weave\n[5] Repeat this process until your piece is at the size you desire. See below demonstration for throwing the first pick\n[6] Demo for the first pick. For the first pick, leave a little bit of extra thread on the end for finishing purposes later on.\nEach pick after this (throwing the yarn and beating it) will look identical, the only difference is that your thread will line up with the edge of your piece at later rows as it wraps from one row to the next.\n[7] Demo for a pick in the middle. To create a clean edge, try and pull your yarn close to the outermost warp thread after you throw the shuttle.\nFinishing Your Piece\n[1] Your piece is finished! You just threw your last pick and now you are ready to remove it from the loom. First, cut a long lead that removes your shuttles from your piece (about the same length as what you left on the first pick)\n[2] Now, release the tension on the loom by pressing the break release foot pedal (rightmost treadle). This treadle is connected to the warp roller and slowly unwinds the warp, allowing more yarn to come forward for use.\n[3] Now that the warp is loose, cut small portions at a time to release your piece from the loom. Leave a few inches of warp on your piece to ensure the last pick does not unravel\n[4] At each cut, make a slip knot to keep the warp from falling out of the beater.\n[5] Once your piece is cut loose, you should have all of your warp knots tied. Your piece will just be connected to the front apron rod.\n[6] Next, you can slide your piece off of the front apron rod. You will have frayed edges that you can then finish. Run the piece through a sewing machine with a straight stitch to ensure the piece does not unravel.\nTC2 Loom # TC2 Loom Anatomy\nTC2 Process Overview Idea Generation TODO\nAdacad TODO\nPhotoshop TODO\nDrive TODO\nTC2 Software TODO\nWeave TODO\nKey Terms # beat/pack: action for closing the shed and pressing the new weft on top of the previous weft beater: packs the inserted weft yarns down.

If you just want to be inspired by the glory of fiber and yarn, you can shop Habu Yarns or Weaver House to source things like horse hair, banana, and paper yarns.\n"},{"id":62,"href":"/docs/structure/braid/","title":"Braid","section":"Structure","content":" Braid # a close up of a braided cord. nylon roving was directly braided into this structure.\nA braid is a structure that is created by interlacing singles, plied yarns and/or filaments in a flat, but more often, tubular structure. The most noticeable difference between a plied structure and a braided one is that the braid requires materials to travel in two directions around a center point. A tubular braid is a hollow structure and can be left hollow for particular applications and has particularly good mechanical properties for artificial muscles. These are created because, with slippery materials, the braid will increase its cross-sectional diameter when compressed, and narrow when stretched (a tubular scissor linkage).\nYet, we often find braiding as a method of adding strength around a core, for instance, in the creation of climbing rope or as a decorative \u0026ldquo;shell\u0026rdquo; for a mundane appliance cord. The advantage to braiding is that it makes it slightly easier to combine several different materials (e.g. conductive and non-conductive materials) as you have a bit more control over tension within braiding than you do with spinning.\nBraiding can be performed with in spun yarn, filament, or even more complex structures such as knitted cord, as I found when I was disassembling some old shoelaces:\nA Deconstructed Shoe Lace: the red and green cords are the braided outer sheaths and the multi-colored strands were knitted insides of the lace.\nPrimary Measurements: # Because of the multitude of factors that can be used in a braid, I do not know of any standard measurement across all applications. Measurements of braided rope or cord express the measurements of the various components involved. For instance, I found this set of measurements for parachute cord online:\nDiameter of approximately 4.0mm (5/32”)\n7 - 2 ply cabled inner nylon strands\nNylon 32 strand woven outer sheath\nThis tells me inside of the braid there are 7 individual nylon strands each having a 2-ply structure. I\u0026rsquo;m assuming that 32 individual strands of nylon are then used to braid the outer sheath.\n"},{"id":63,"href":"/docs/structure/core-spun-yarn/","title":"Core Spun Yarn","section":"Structure","content":" Core Spun Yarn # Core spun yarns describe a multi-layered yarn structure where fiber is spun around a single continuous filament in the core. This is a common technique for creating conductive yarns. The internal material is referred to as the core, and the outer is referred to as the sheath. There is a seemingly endless combination and set of techniques for constructing core spun yarns, which you can find here.\nA close up of the end of a core spun thread.

This includes materials like rubber tubing, paper strips, chainlink, materials that can be rolled or torn into long lengths like old blankets and rags, or even vines.\nFurthermore, any material that lends itself to being threaded can be used in a textile. For instance, materials like sequins, beads, or other fabrics can be threaded onto a yarn prior to braiding, knitting or weaving, giving an additional set of textures. The through-holes on an Arduino can be threaded through by a conductive yarn to bind the hardware onto the surface (or within the structure) of a knitted or woven material.\nOther solid materials can be integrated into the core of core-spun yarns, including fragments of wood, small ball bearings, magnets, etc.\n"}]
