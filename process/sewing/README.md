# Sewing, Quilting, & Fabric Manipulation

A surface application for binding a single fabric into different structures and/or connecting pieces of fabric together, or interlacing a yarn through a fabric. It is one of the more common techniques used for  e-textiles as a conductive thread serves the role as a wire within a simple circuit. The two most common techniques for sewing are [hand sewing](hand-sewing.md) and [machine sewing](machine-sewing.md) and each process follows a similar ordering of steps \(though the instructions for implementation vary for if you are working by hand or machine. 

## Fabric Manipulation

Sewing is a great way to add texture and surface details to your project and there are needly countless ways that sewing can bind fabrics together or bind a fabric to itself to create textures. These techniques for added structure are described as Fabric Manipulation. For resources on these techniques we recommend:

## Quilting

Quilting is another common way in which several smaller patches of fabric and joined into larger structures for the purposes of making blankets, rags, and/or quilted garments \(such as jackets\).
