# Hand Knitting

Hand knitting takes place with knitting needles, manipulated by the hands. This technique allows for playful discovery of stitches and structures and, depending on the kind of needle, can be used to knit surfaces, tubes, or volumes.  The material, gauge, stitch, and needle size all shift the texture of the knit itself, giving way to more stretchy, bully, light, or rigid textures. Textures in handknitting can change at any point in the process across the surface by changing the stitch. This is how you can create one garment with different properties in different regions.
