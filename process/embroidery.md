# Embroidery

embroidery is a surface application technique applied to existing fabrics. It is similar to and often used in conjunction with [sewing](sewing/), bit focuses much more on the application of threads to the surface of a fabric for decorative and/or functional purposes. 



| Structure | Ability to be Emboiderd or Embroidered Upon by Hand | By Machine |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Raw Fiber | no | no |
| Filament | yes? \(perhaps through laying? or by hand.  | no? |
| Roving & Top | no?   | no |
| Singles | no, not strong enough but with a delicate hand.  | no |
| Plied Yarn | yes | yes |
| Braided Rope | yes, if its fine enough and/or large enough to be embroidered upon | if its fine |
| Knits | yes, but typically needs to be fine knit and stabilized  | yes with stabilization |
| Woven | yes for narrow, flat, or tubular weaves | yes |
| Non-Wovens | yes, if sliced or rolled into thin long pieces | yes? |
| Solid Objects | no, but can be used to attach solid objects | same |

## Hand embroidery

Hand embroidery is an effective technique for adding surface details and often requires the use of a technique for stabilizing the fabric as you puncture in and out of it. This can be an [embroidery hoop](https://www.joann.com/wood-quilt-hoop-18in-3-4in-depth/2810984.html) and/or [adhesive stabilizer](https://www.embstore.com/product-category/backing-and-topping/?utm_term=embroidery%20stabilizer&utm_campaign=&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=5658369370&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_cam=1781169742&hsa_ad=414200088471&hsa_kw=embroidery%20stabilizer&hsa_grp=79958327882&hsa_mt=e&hsa_ver=3&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-300230907070&gclid=EAIaIQobChMItLyh7Jn96wIVnD6tBh0mcA3-EAAYAiAAEgKYkPD_BwE).  

Stitch Floral offers a great introduction to many basic hand embroidery techniques

## Machine Embroidery

Embroidery machines offer a much wider set of design features for doing thread-based patterning and structural deformations on the surface of a fabric. You can get small machines or room-sized machines. High end embroidery machines can lay and cover threads, for instance, if you need to run insulated traces across the surface of fabric. I have also seen them be able to programmatically join a thread to micro-controller througholes! 

You can also achieve free hand machine embroidery using a [conventional sewing machine](sewing/machine-sewing.md#conventional-sewing-machines) if you have a machine where you can lower the feed dogs.
